It reminds me of my very first day at Microsoft, 22 years ago. Like you, I had a choice about where to come to work. I came here because I believed Microsoft was the best company in the world. I saw then how clearly we empower people to do magical things with our creations and ultimately make the world a better place. I knew there was no better company to join if I wanted to make a difference. This is the very same inspiration that continues to drive me today.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is an incredible honor for me to lead and serve this great company of ours. Steve and Bill have taken it from an idea to one of the greatest and most universally admired companies in the world. I\\u2019ve been fortunate to work closely with both Bill and Steve in my different roles at Microsoft, and as I step in as CEO, I\\u2019ve asked Bill to devote additional time to the company, focused on technology and products. I\\u2019m also looking forward to working with John Thompson as our new Chairman of the Board.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile we have seen great success, we are hungry to do more. Our industry does not respect tradition \\u2014 it only respects innovation. This is a critical time for the industry and for Microsoft. Make no mistake, we are headed for greater places \\u2014 as technology evolves and we evolve with and ahead of it. Our job is to ensure that Microsoft thrives in a mobile and cloud-first world.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs we start a new phase of our journey together, I wanted to share some background on myself and what inspires and motivates me.\\r\\n\\r\\nWho am I?\\r\\n\\r\\nI am 46. I\\u2019ve been married for 22 years and we have 3 kids. And like anyone else, a lot of what I do and how I think has been shaped by my family and my overall life experiences. Many who know me say I am also defined by my curiosity and thirst for learning. I buy more books than I can finish. I sign up for more online courses than I can complete. I fundamentally believe that if you are not learning new things, you stop doing great and useful things. So family, curiosity and hunger for knowledge all define me.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhy am I here?\\r\\n\\r\\nI am here for the same reason I think most people join Microsoft \\u2014 to change the world through technology that empowers people to do amazing things. I know it can sound hyperbolic \\u2014 and yet it\\u2019s true. We have done it, we\\u2019re doing it today, and we are the team that will do it again.\\r\\n\\r\\nI believe over the next decade computing will become even more ubiquitous and intelligence will become ambient. The coevolution of software and new hardware form factors will intermediate and digitize \\u2014 many of the things we do and experience in business, life and our world. This will be made possible by an ever-growing network of connected devices, incredible computing capacity from the cloud, insights from big data, and intelligence from machine learning.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis is a software-powered world.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt will better connect us to our friends and families and help us see, express, and share our world in ways never before possible. It will enable businesses to engage customers in more meaningful ways.\\r\\n\\r\\nI am here because we have unparalleled capability to make an impact.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhy are we here?\\r\\n\\r\\nIn our early history, our mission was about the PC on every desk and home, a goal we have mostly achieved in the developed world. Today we\\u2019re focused on a broader range of devices. While the deal is not yet complete, we will welcome to our family Nokia devices and services and the new mobile capabilities they bring us.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs we look forward, we must zero in on what Microsoft can uniquely contribute to the world. The opportunity ahead will require us to reimagine a lot of what we have done in the past for a mobile and cloud-first world, and do new things.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe are the only ones who can harness the power of software and deliver it through devices and services that truly empower every individual and every organization. We are the only company with history and continued focus in building platforms and ecosystems that create broad opportunity.\\r\\n\\r\\nQi Lu captured it well in a recent meeting when he said that Microsoft uniquely empowers people to \\u201cdo more.\\u201d This doesn\\u2019t mean that we need to do more things, but that the work we do empowers the world to do more of what they care about \\u2014 get stuff done, have fun, communicate and accomplish great things. This is the core of who we are, and driving this core value in all that we do \\u2014 be it the cloud or device experiences \\u2014 is why we are here.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat do we do next?\\r\\n\\r\\nTo paraphrase a quote from Oscar Wilde \\u2014 we need to believe in the impossible and remove the improbable.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis starts with clarity of purpose and sense of mission that will lead us to imagine the impossible and deliver it. We need to prioritize innovation that is centered on our core value of empowering users and organizations to \\u201cdo more.\\u201d We have picked a set of high-value activities as part of our One Microsoft strategy. And with every service and device launch going forward we need to bring more innovation to bear around these scenarios.\\r\\n\\r\\nNext, every one of us needs to do our best work, lead and help drive cultural change. We sometimes underestimate what we each can do to make things happen and overestimate what others need to do to move us forward. We must change this.\\r\\n\\r\\nFinally, I truly believe that each of us must find meaning in our work. The best work happens when you know that it\\u2019s not just work, but something that will improve other people\\u2019s lives. This is the opportunity that drives each of us at this company.\\r\\n\\r\\nMany companies aspire to change the world. But very few have all the elements required: talent, resources, and perseverance. Microsoft has proven that it has all three in abundance. And as the new CEO, I can\\u2019t ask for a better foundation.\\r\\n\\r\\nLet\\u2019s build on this foundation together.\\r\\n\\r\\nSatya\\n\\n\",\"languageCode\":\"en\",\"keyPhrases\":[],\"organizations\":[\"Microsoft\"],\"translatedText\":null},{\"@search.score\":0.1359176,\"id\":\"aHR0cHM6Ly9vbXNlYXJjaGJsb2IuYmxvYi5jb3JlLndpbmRvd3MubmV0L2Jhc2ljZGVtby9yZWFkbWUubWQ1\",\"content\":\"# LearnAI Team - Knowledge Mining Dataset\\r\\n\\r\\nThis is the dataset we will for the trainining.

BUSINESS \\n GENERAL \\n Our vision \\n Microsoft is a technology company whose mission is to empower every person and every organization on the planet to achieve more. Our strategy is to build best-in-class platforms and productivity services for a\\nmobile-first, cloud-first world. \\n The mobile-first, cloud-first world is transforming the way individuals and organizations use and\\ninteract with technology. Mobility is not focused on any one device; it is centered on the mobility of experiences that, in turn, are orchestrated by the cloud. Cloud computing and storage solutions provide people and enterprises with various\\ncapabilities to store and process their data in third-party datacenters. Mobility encompasses the rich collection of data, applications, and services that accompany our customers as they move from setting to setting in their lives. We are\\ntransforming our businesses to enable Microsoft to lead the direction of this digital transformation, and enable our customers and partners to thrive in this evolving world. \\n What we offer \\n Founded in 1975, we operate worldwide in over 190 countries. We develop,\\nlicense, and support a wide range of software products, services, and devices that deliver new opportunities, greater convenience, and enhanced value to people\\u2019s lives. \\n Our products include operating systems; cross-device productivity applications; server applications; business solution applications; desktop and server management tools; software development tools; video games; and\\ntraining and certification of computer system integrators and developers. We also design, manufacture, and sell devices, including PCs, tablets, gaming and entertainment consoles, phones, other intelligent devices, and related accessories, that\\nintegrate with our cloud-based offerings. We offer an array of services, including cloud-based solutions that provide customers with software, services, platforms, and content, and we provide solution support and consulting services. We also deliver\\nrelevant online advertising to a global audience. \\n The ambitions that drive us \\n\\nTo carry out our strategy, our research and development efforts focus on three interconnected ambitions: \\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\t\\u00a0\\t\\u2022\\t\\u00a0\\t Reinvent productivity and business processes. \\n\\n\\n\\n \\u00a0\\n 3 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\u00a0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n PART I \\n Item 1 \\n \\u00a0\\n\\n\\n\\t\\u00a0\\t\\u2022\\t\\u00a0\\t Build the intelligent cloud platform. \\n\\n\\n \\u00a0\\n\\n\\t\\u00a0\\t\\u2022\\t\\u00a0\\t Create more personal computing. \\n\\n\\n\\nReinvent productivity and business processes \\n\\nWe believe we can significantly enhance the lives of our customers using our broad portfolio of productivity, communication, and information\\nservices that span devices and platforms. Productivity will be the first and foremost objective, to enable people to meet and collaborate more easily, and to effectively express ideas in new ways. We invent new scenarios that in turn create\\nopportunity for our partners and help businesses accelerate their transformation while respecting each person\\u2019s privacy choices. The foundation for these efforts will rest on advancing our leading productivity, collaboration, communication, and\\nbusiness process tools including Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook, OneNote, OneDrive, Skype, and Microsoft Dynamics (\\u201cDynamics\\u201d). With Office 365, we provide these familiar industry-leading productivity and business process tools as cloud\\nservices, enabling access from anywhere and any device.\\u00a0This creates an opportunity to reach new customers and expand the usage of our services by our existing customers. We see opportunity in combining our offerings in new ways that are\\nmobile, collaborative, intelligent and trustworthy. We offer our services across platforms and devices outside our own. As people move from device to device, so will their content and the richness of their services. We engineer our applications so\\nusers can find, try, and buy them in friction-free ways. \\n Build the intelligent cloud platform \\n\\nIn deploying technology that advances business strategy, enterprises decide what solutions will make employees more productive, collaborative, and\\nsatisfied, and connect with customers in new and compelling ways. They work to unlock business insights from a world of data. To achieve these objectives, increasingly businesses look to leverage the benefits of the cloud. Helping businesses move to\\nthe cloud is one of our largest opportunities, and we believe we work from a position of strength. Microsoft is one of two leaders in the market. \\n The shift to the cloud is driven by three important economies of scale: larger datacenters can deploy computational resources at significantly lower cost per unit than smaller ones; larger datacenters can\\ncoordinate and aggregate diverse customer, geographic, and application demand patterns, improving the utilization of computing, storage, and network resources; and multi-tenancy lowers application maintenance labor costs for large public clouds. As\\none of the largest providers of cloud computing at scale, we are well-positioned to help businesses move to the cloud and focus on innovation while leaving non-differentiating activities to reliable and cost-effective providers like Microsoft.\\n\\n We believe our server products and cloud services, which include Microsoft SQL Server (\\u201cSQL Server\\u201d), Windows Server, Visual\\nStudio, System Center, and Microsoft Azure (\\u201cAzure\\u201d), make us the only company with a public, private, and hybrid cloud platform that can power modern business. With Azure, we are one of very few cloud vendors that run at a scale that\\nmeets the needs of businesses of all sizes and complexities. We are working to enhance the return on IT investment by enabling enterprises to combine their existing datacenters and our public cloud into a single cohesive infrastructure. Businesses\\ncan deploy applications in their own datacenter, a partner\\u2019s datacenter, or in our datacenters with common security, management, and administration across all environments, with the flexibility and scale they want. \\n\\nWe enable organizations to securely adopt software-as-a-service applications, both our own and third-party, and integrate them with their existing\\nsecurity and management infrastructure. We continue to innovate with higher-level services including identity and directory services that manage employee corporate identity and manage and secure corporate information accessed and stored across a\\ngrowing number of devices, rich data storage and analytics services, machine learning services, media services, web and mobile backend services, and developer productivity services. To foster a rich developer ecosystem, our platform is extensible,\\nenabling customers and partners to further customize and enhance our solutions, achieving even more value. This strategy requires continuing investment in datacenters and other infrastructure to support our services. \\n\\n \\u00a0\\n 4 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\u00a0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n PART I \\n Item 1 \\n \\u00a0\\n\\n Create more personal computing \\n We strive to make computing more personal by putting users at the core of the experience, enabling them to interact with technology in more intuitive, engaging, and dynamic ways. A computing device should be not\\njust a tool, but a partner. Windows\\u00a010 is the cornerstone of our ambition to usher in this era of more personal computing. We consider the launch of Windows 10 in July 2015 to be a transformative moment as we moved from an operating system that\\nruns on a PC to a service that can power the full spectrum of devices. We developed Windows 10 not only to be familiar to our users, but more safe, secure, and always up-to-date. Windows 10 is more personal and productive with functionality such as\\nCortana, Windows Hello, Windows Ink, Microsoft Edge, and universal applications. Windows 10 is designed to foster innovation \\u2013 from us, our partners, and developers \\u2013 through rich and consistent experiences across the range of existing\\ndevices and entirely new device categories. \\n Our ambition for Windows 10 is to broaden our economic opportunity through three key\\nlevers: an original equipment manufacturer (\\u201cOEM\\u201d) ecosystem that creates exciting new hardware designs for Windows 10; our own commitment to the health and profitability of our first-party premium device portfolio; and monetization\\nopportunities such as services, subscriptions, gaming, and search advertising. Our OEM partners are investing in an extensive portfolio of hardware designs and configurations for Windows 10. We now have the widest range of Windows hardware ever\\navailable. \\n With the unified Windows operating system, developers and OEMs can contribute to a thriving Windows ecosystem. We invest\\nheavily to make Windows the most secure, manageable, and capable operating system for the needs of a modern workforce.

Vertically integrated computer manufacturers such as Hewlett-Packard, IBM, and Oracle offer their own versions of the Unix operating system preinstalled on server hardware. Nearly all computer manufacturers offer server hardware for the\\nLinux operating system and many contribute to Linux operating system development. The competitive position of Linux has also benefited from the large number of compatible applications now produced by many commercial and non-commercial software\\ndevelopers. A number of companies, such as Red Hat, supply versions of Linux. \\n We compete to provide enterprise-wide computing solutions\\nand point solutions with numerous commercial software vendors that offer solutions and middleware technology platforms, software applications for connectivity (both Internet and intranet), security, hosting, database, and e-business servers. IBM and\\nOracle lead a group of companies focused on the Java Platform Enterprise Edition that competes with our enterprise-wide computing solutions. Commercial competitors for our server applications for PC-based distributed client/server environments\\ninclude CA Technologies, IBM, and Oracle. Our web application platform software competes with open source software such as Apache, Linux, MySQL, and PHP. In middleware, we compete against Java vendors. \\n\\nOur database, business intelligence, and data warehousing solutions offerings compete with products from IBM, Oracle, SAP, and other companies. Our\\nsystem management solutions compete with server management and server virtualization platform providers, such as BMC, CA Technologies, Hewlett-Packard, IBM, and VMware. Our products for software developers compete against offerings from Adobe, IBM,\\nOracle, other companies, and open-source projects, including Eclipse (sponsored by CA Technologies, IBM, Oracle, and SAP), PHP, and Ruby on Rails, among others. \\n We believe our server products provide customers with advantages in performance, total costs of ownership, and productivity by delivering superior applications, development tools, compatibility with a broad base of\\nhardware and software applications, security, and manageability. \\n Azure faces diverse competition from companies such as Amazon, Google,\\nIBM, Oracle, Salesforce.com, VMware, and open source offerings. Azure\\u2019s competitive advantage includes enabling a hybrid cloud, allowing deployment of existing datacenters with our public cloud into a single, cohesive infrastructure, and the\\nability to run at a scale that meets the needs of businesses of all sizes and complexities. \\n Our Enterprise Services business competes\\nwith a wide range of companies that provide strategy and business planning, application development, and infrastructure services, including multinational consulting firms and small niche businesses focused on specific technologies. \\n\\nMore Personal Computing \\n Our More Personal\\nComputing segment consists of products and services geared towards harmonizing the interests of end users, developers, and IT professionals across screens of all sizes. This segment primarily comprises: \\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\t\\u00a0\\t\\u2022\\t\\u00a0\\t Windows, including Windows OEM licensing (\\u201cWindows OEM\\u201d) and other non-volume licensing of the Windows operating system, volume licensing of the\\nWindows operating system, patent licensing, Windows Embedded, MSN display advertising, and Windows Phone licensing. \\n\\n\\n \\u00a0\\n\\n\\t\\u00a0\\t\\u2022\\t\\u00a0\\t Devices, including Microsoft Surface (\\u201cSurface\\u201d), phones, and PC accessories. \\n\\n\\n\\n \\u00a0\\n 8 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\u00a0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n PART I \\n Item 1 \\n \\u00a0\\n\\n\\n\\t\\u00a0\\t\\u2022\\t\\u00a0\\t Gaming, including Xbox hardware; Xbox Live, comprising transactions, subscriptions, and advertising; video games; and third-party video game royalties.\\n\\n\\n\\n \\u00a0\\n\\n\\t\\u00a0\\t\\u2022\\t\\u00a0\\t Search advertising. \\n\\n\\n Windows\\n\\n The Windows operating system is designed to deliver a more personal computing experience for users by enabling consistency of\\nexperience, applications, and information across their devices. We consider the launch of Windows 10 in July 2015 to be a transformative moment as we moved from an operating system that runs on a PC to a service that can power the full spectrum of\\ndevices. \\n Windows revenue is impacted significantly by the number of Windows operating system licenses purchased by OEMs, which they\\npre-install on the devices they sell. In addition to computing device market volume, Windows revenue is impacted by: \\n \\u00a0\\n\\n\\t\\u00a0\\t\\u2022\\t\\u00a0\\t The mix of computing devices based on form factor and screen size. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\t\\u00a0\\t\\u2022\\t\\u00a0\\t Differences in device market demand between developed markets and emerging markets. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\t\\u00a0\\t\\u2022\\t\\u00a0\\t Attachment of Windows to devices shipped. \\n\\n\\n \\u00a0\\n\\n\\t\\u00a0\\t\\u2022\\t\\u00a0\\t Customer mix between consumer, small- and medium-sized businesses, and large enterprises. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\t\\u00a0\\t\\u2022\\t\\u00a0\\t Changes in inventory levels in the OEM channel. \\n\\n\\n \\u00a0\\n\\n\\t\\u00a0\\t\\u2022\\t\\u00a0\\t Pricing changes and promotions, pricing variation that occurs when the mix of devices manufactured shifts from local and regional system builders to large\\nmultinational OEMs, and different pricing of Windows versions licensed. \\n\\n\\n \\u00a0\\n\\n\\t\\u00a0\\t\\u2022\\t\\u00a0\\t Piracy. \\n\\n\\n Volume licensing\\nof the Windows operating system is affected mainly by the demand from commercial customers for volume licensing and Software Assurance, often reflecting the number of information workers in a licensed enterprise, and is therefore relatively\\nindependent of the number of PCs sold in a given year. \\n Patent licensing includes our programs to license patents across a broad array\\nof technology areas, including mobile devices and cloud offerings. \\n Windows Embedded extends the power of Windows and the cloud to\\nintelligent systems by delivering specialized operating systems, tools, and services. \\n Display advertising primarily includes MSN ads.\\nIn June 2015, we entered into agreements with AOL and AppNexus to outsource our display sales responsibility. \\n The Windows Phone\\noperating system is designed to bring users closer to the people, applications, and content they need. Prior to our acquisition of Nokia Corporation\\u2019s (\\u201cNokia\\u201d) Devices and Services business (\\u201cNDS\\u201d) in April 2014, Microsoft\\nand Nokia jointly created new mobile products and services and extended established products and services to new markets through a strategic alliance. \\n\\nDevices \\n We design, manufacture, and sell\\ndevices such as Surface, phones, and other intelligent devices, as well as PC accessories. Our devices are designed to enable people and organizations to connect to the people and content that matter most using integrated Microsoft services and\\nWindows. Surface is designed to help organizations, students, and consumers to be more productive. Our latest Surface devices, the Surface Pro 4 and Surface Book, were released in October 2015. We began manufacturing and selling Microsoft Lumia\\n(\\u201cLumia\\u201d) phones and other phones with the acquisition of NDS in April 2014. In July 2015, we announced a plan to restructure our phone business to better focus and align resources. In May 2016, we announced plans to further streamline our\\nsmartphone hardware business. We also recently announced the sale of our entry-level feature phone business in May 2016. The transaction is expected to close in the second half of 2016, subject to regulatory approvals and other closing conditions.\\n\\n\\n \\u00a0\\n 9 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\u00a0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n PART I \\n Item 1 \\n \\u00a0\\n\\n Gaming \\n Our gaming platform is designed to provide a unique variety of entertainment through the use of our devices, peripherals, applications, online services, and content. We released Xbox 360 and Xbox One in November\\n2005 and November\\u00a02013, respectively, and recently announced Xbox One S will be released in August 2016. We also launched our Windows 10 Xbox app in July 2015. Xbox Live enables people to connect and share online gaming experiences and is\\naccessible on Xbox consoles, Windows-enabled devices, and other devices.\\u00a0Xbox Live services consist of subscriptions and sales of Xbox Live enabled content, as well as advertising, and are designed to benefit users by providing access to a\\nnetwork of certified applications and services and to benefit our developer and partner ecosystems by providing access to a large customer base. We also design and sell gaming content to showcase our unique platform capabilities for Xbox consoles,\\nWindows-enabled devices, and other devices. We acquired Mojang Synergies AB, the Swedish video game developer of the Minecraft gaming franchise, in November 2014. The addition of Minecraft and its community enhances our gaming portfolio across\\nWindows, Xbox, and other ecosystems besides our own. We believe the success of our gaming business is determined by the overall active user base through Xbox Live enabled content, availability of games, providing exclusive game content that gamers\\nseek, the computational power and reliability of the devices used to access our content and services, and the ability to create new experiences via online services, downloadable content, and peripherals. \\n\\nSearch Advertising \\n Search advertising,\\nincluding Bing and Bing Ads, is designed to deliver relevant online advertising to a global audience. We have several partnerships with other companies, including Yahoo!, in which we provide and monetize search results. Growth depends on our ability\\nto attract new users, understand intent, and match intent with relevant content and advertiser offerings. \\n Competition \\n\\nThe Windows operating system faces competition from various software products and from alternative platforms and devices, mainly from Apple and\\nGoogle. We believe Windows competes effectively by giving customers choice, value, flexibility, security, an easy-to-use interface, and compatibility with a broad range of hardware and software applications, including those that enable productivity.\\n\\n Our devices face competition from various computer, tablet, hardware, and phone manufacturers, and offer a unique combination of\\nhigh-quality industrial design and innovative technologies across various price points, many of which are also current or potential partners and customers. These manufacturers include Apple, as well as our Windows OEM partners. \\n\\nOur gaming platform competes with console platforms from Sony and Nintendo, both of which have a large, established base of customers. The\\nlifecycle for gaming and entertainment consoles averages five to ten years. Nintendo released their latest generation console in November 2012. Sony released their latest generation console in November 2013. \\n\\nIn addition to Sony and Nintendo, we compete with other providers of entertainment services through online marketplaces.\\u00a0We believe our gaming\\nplatform is effectively positioned against competitive products and services based on significant innovation in hardware architecture, user interface, developer tools, online gaming and entertainment services, and continued strong exclusive content\\nfrom our own game franchises as well as other digital content offerings. Our video games competitors include Electronic Arts and Activision Blizzard. Xbox Live faces competition from various online marketplaces, including those operated by Amazon,\\nApple, and Google. \\n Our search advertising business competes with Google and a wide array of websites, social platforms like Facebook,\\nand portals that provide content and online offerings to end users. \\n\\n \\u00a0\\n 10 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\u00a0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n PART I \\n Item 1 \\n \\u00a0\\n\\n OPERATIONS \\n We have operations centers that support all operations in their regions, including customer contract and order processing, credit and collections, information processing, and vendor management and logistics. The\\nregional center in Ireland supports the European, Middle Eastern, and African region; the center in Singapore supports the Japan, India, Greater China, and Asia-Pacific region; and the centers in Fargo, North Dakota, Fort Lauderdale, Florida, Puerto\\nRico, Redmond, Washington, and Reno, Nevada support Latin America and North America. In addition to the operations centers, we also operate datacenters throughout the Americas, Australia, Europe, and Asia. \\n\\nTo serve the needs of customers around the world and to improve the quality and usability of products in international markets, we localize many of\\nour products to reflect local languages and conventions. Localizing a product may require modifying the user interface, altering dialog boxes, and translating text. \\n We operate manufacturing facilities for the production and customization of phones, predominantly in Vietnam. We announced the sale of our entry-level feature phone business in May 2016, which includes the sale of\\nour phone manufacturing facility in Vietnam. \\n Our devices, other than phones, are primarily manufactured by third-party contract\\nmanufacturers. We generally have the ability to use other manufacturers if a current vendor becomes unavailable or unable to meet our requirements. \\n RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT \\n During fiscal years 2016, 2015, and 2014, research and development\\nexpense was $12.0 billion, $12.0 billion, and $11.4\\u00a0billion, respectively. These amounts represented 14%, 13%, and 13% of revenue in fiscal years 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively. We plan to continue to make significant investments in a broad\\nrange of research and development efforts. \\n Product and Service Development, and Intellectual Property \\n\\nWe develop most of our products and services internally through three engineering groups. \\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\t\\u00a0\\t\\u2022\\t\\u00a0\\t Applications and Services Engineering Group, focuses on broad applications and services core technologies in productivity, communication, education,\\nsearch, and other information categories. \\n\\n\\n \\u00a0\\n\\n\\t\\u00a0\\t\\u2022\\t\\u00a0\\t Cloud and Enterprise Engineering Group, focuses on our cloud infrastructure, server, database, CRM, enterprise resource planning, management,\\ndevelopment tools, and other business process applications and services for enterprises. \\n\\n\\n \\u00a0\\n\\n\\t\\u00a0\\t\\u2022\\t\\u00a0\\t Windows and Devices Engineering Group, focuses on our Windows platform across devices of all types, hardware development of our devices, and associated\\nonline marketplaces. \\n\\n\\n Internal development allows us to maintain competitive advantages that come from product\\ndifferentiation and closer technical control over our products and services. It also gives us the freedom to decide which modifications and enhancements are most important and when they should be implemented. We strive to obtain information as early\\nas possible about changing usage patterns and hardware advances that may affect software design. Before releasing new software platforms, we provide application vendors with a range of resources and guidelines for development, training, and testing.\\nGenerally, we also create product documentation internally. \\n We protect our intellectual property investments in a variety of ways. We\\nwork actively in the U.S. and internationally to ensure the enforcement of copyright, trademark, trade secret, and other protections that apply to our software and hardware products, services, business plans, and branding. We are a leader among\\ntechnology companies in pursuing patents and currently have a portfolio of over 61,000 U.S. and international patents issued and over 35,000 \\n\\n \\u00a0\\n 11 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\u00a0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n PART I \\n Item 1 \\n \\u00a0\\n\\n \\npending. While we employ much of our internally developed intellectual property exclusively in Microsoft products and services, we also engage in outbound and inbound licensing of specific\\npatented technologies that are incorporated into licensees\\u2019 or Microsoft\\u2019s products. From time to time, we enter into broader cross-license agreements with other technology companies covering entire groups of patents. We also purchase or\\nlicense technology that we incorporate into our products or services. At times, we make select intellectual property broadly available at no or low cost to achieve a strategic objective, such as promoting industry standards, advancing\\ninteroperability, or attracting and enabling our external development community. \\n While it may be necessary in the future to seek or\\nrenew licenses relating to various aspects of our products and business methods, we believe, based upon past experience and industry practice, such licenses generally could be obtained on commercially reasonable terms. We believe our continuing\\nresearch and product development are not materially dependent on any single license or other agreement with a third party relating to the development of our products. \\n Investing in the Future \\n Microsoft\\u2019s success is based on our ability to create new and\\ncompelling products, services, and experiences for our users, to initiate and embrace disruptive technology trends, to enter new geographic and product markets, and to drive broad adoption of our products and services. We invest in a range of\\nemerging technology trends and breakthroughs that we believe offer significant opportunities to deliver value to our customers and growth for the company. Based on our assessment of key technology trends, we maintain our long-term commitment to\\nresearch and development across a wide spectrum of technologies, tools, and platforms spanning digital work and life experiences, cloud computing, and devices operating systems and hardware. \\n\\nWhile our main research and development facilities are located in Redmond, Washington, we also operate research and development facilities in other\\nparts of the U.S. and around the world, including Canada, China, Denmark, Finland, France, India, Ireland, Israel, Japan, and the United Kingdom. This global approach helps us remain competitive in local markets and enables us to continue to attract\\ntop talent from across the world. We generally fund research at the corporate level to ensure that we are looking beyond immediate product considerations to opportunities further in the future. We also fund research and development activities at the\\nbusiness segment level. Much of our business segment level research and development is coordinated with other segments and leveraged across the company. \\n In addition to our main research and development operations, we also operate Microsoft Research. Microsoft Research is one of the world\\u2019s largest computer science research organizations, and works in close\\ncollaboration with top universities around the world to advance the state-of-the-art in computer science, providing us a unique perspective on future technology trends and contributing to our innovation. \\n\\nDISTRIBUTION, SALES, AND MARKETING \\n We market and distribute our products and services through the following channels: OEMs, distributors and resellers, online, and Microsoft retail stores. Our sales force performs a variety of functions, including\\nworking directly with enterprises and public sector organizations worldwide to identify and meet their software requirements; managing OEM relationships; and supporting solution integrators, independent software vendors, and other partners who\\nengage directly with our customers to perform sales, consulting, and fulfillment functions for our products. \\n OEMs \\n\\nWe distribute software through OEMs that pre-install our software on new devices and servers they sell. The largest component of the OEM business\\nis the Windows operating system pre-installed on computing devices. OEMs also sell hardware pre-installed with other Microsoft products, including server and embedded operating systems and applications such as our Microsoft Office suite. In addition\\nto these products, we also market our services through OEMs and service bundles such as Windows with Bing or Windows with Office 365 subscription. \\n\\n \\u00a0\\n 12 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\u00a0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n PART I \\n Item 1 \\n \\u00a0\\n\\n There are two broad categories of OEMs. The largest OEMs, many of which operate globally, are\\nreferred to as \\u201cDirect OEMs,\\u201d as our relationship with them is managed through a direct agreement between Microsoft and the OEM. We have distribution agreements covering one or more of our products with virtually all of the multinational\\nOEMs, including Acer, ASUST, Dell, Fujitsu, Hewlett-Packard, Lenovo, Samsung, Toshiba, and with many regional and local OEMs. The second broad category of OEMs consists of lower-volume PC manufacturers (also called \\u201csystem builders\\u201d),\\nwhich source their Microsoft software for pre-installation and local redistribution primarily through the Microsoft distributor channel rather than through a direct agreement or relationship with Microsoft. \\n\\nDistributors and Resellers \\n Many\\norganizations that license our products and services through Enterprise Agreements transact directly with us, with sales support from solution integrators, independent software vendors, web agencies, and developers that advise organizations on\\nlicensing our products and services (\\u201cEnterprise Agreement Software Advisors\\u201d, or \\u201cESAs\\u201d). Organizations also license our products and services indirectly, primarily through licensing solution partners (\\u201cLSPs\\u201d),\\ndistributors, value-added resellers (\\u201cVARs\\u201d), OEMs, system builder channels, and retailers. Although each type of reselling partner reaches organizations of all sizes, LSPs are primarily engaged with large organizations, distributors\\nresell primarily to VARs, and VARs typically reach small- and medium-sized organizations. ESAs typically are also authorized as LSPs and operate as resellers for our other licensing programs, such as the Select Plus and Open licensing programs\\ndiscussed under \\u201cLicensing Options\\u201d below. Some of our distributors include Ingram Micro and Tech Data, and some of our largest resellers include CDW, Dell, Insight Enterprises, and Software House International. \\n\\nOur Dynamics software offerings are also licensed to enterprises through a global network of channel partners providing vertical solutions and\\nspecialized services. We distribute our retail packaged products primarily through independent non-exclusive distributors, authorized replicators, resellers, and retail outlets. Individual consumers obtain these products primarily through retail\\noutlets, including Microsoft retail stores. We distribute our devices through third-party retailers and Microsoft retail stores. Our phones are also distributed through global wireless communications carriers. We have a network of field sales\\nrepresentatives and field support personnel that solicit orders from distributors and resellers, and provide product training and sales support. \\n\\nOnline \\n Although on-premises software\\ncontinues to be an important part of our business, increasingly we are delivering additional value to customers through cloud-based services. We provide commercial cloud-based solutions such as Office 365, Azure, and Dynamics CRM Online. We also\\nprovide online content services to consumers through Bing, MSN portals and channels, Office 365, Xbox Live, Outlook.com, OneDrive, Skype, and Windows Store. Other services delivered online include our online advertising platform with offerings for\\nadvertisers and publishers, as well as Microsoft Developer Network subscription content and updates, periodic product updates, and online technical and practice readiness resources to support our partners in developing and selling our products and\\nsolutions. As we increasingly deliver online services, we sell many of these cloud-based services through our enterprise agreements and have also enabled new sales programs to reach small and medium-sized businesses.\\u00a0These programs include\\ndirect sales, direct sales supported by a large network of partner advisors, and resale of services through operator channels, such as telephone, cell, and cable providers. \\n We also sell our products through our Microsoft retail stores and online marketplaces. \\n LICENSING\\nOPTIONS \\n We license software to organizations under agreements that allow the customer to acquire multiple licenses of products and\\nservices. Our agreements for organizations to acquire multiple licenses of products and services are designed to provide them with a means of doing so without having to acquire separate licenses through retail channels. In delivering organizational\\nlicensing agreements to the market, we use different programs designed to provide flexibility for organizations of various sizes. While these programs may differ in various parts of the world, generally they include those discussed below.\\n\\n\\n \\u00a0\\n 13 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\u00a0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n PART I \\n Item 1 \\n \\u00a0\\n\\n Customer Licensing Programs \\n Enterprise Agreement Licensing \\n Designed primarily for medium- and large-sized organizations\\nthat want to obtain the best value by standardizing on a common IT platform across their organization. Under the Enterprise Agreement, customers can acquire licenses for online services and/or software products with Software Assurance, which convey\\nrights to future versions of certain software products over the contract period. Software Assurance also provides support, tools, and training to help customers deploy and use software efficiently. Enterprises can elect to acquire perpetual licenses\\nor, under the Enterprise Subscription option, can acquire non-perpetual, subscription licenses for a specified period (generally three years). Online services are also available, and subscriptions are generally structured with three-year terms.\\n\\n Microsoft Product and Services Agreement Licensing \\n Suited for medium- and large-sized organizations, the Microsoft Products and Services Agreement (\\u201cMPSA\\u201d) provides customers the ability to purchase online services subscriptions, software licenses,\\nsoftware licenses with Software Assurance, and renewals of Software Assurance through a single agreement.\\u00a0Software Assurance and online services subscriptions are generally available for a term of up to three years. We plan on expanding the\\noffers under the MPSA in fiscal year 2017 to better enable organizations to obtain the best value by standardizing on a common IT platform across their organization. \\n Select Plus Licensing \\n Designed primarily for medium- and large-sized organizations, the\\nSelect Plus program allows customers to acquire perpetual licenses and, at the customer\\u2019s election, Software Assurance over a specified time period (generally three years or less). Similar to Open programs, the Select Plus program allows\\ncustomers to acquire licenses only, acquire licenses with Software Assurance, or renew Software Assurance upon the expiration of existing volume licensing agreements. A subset of online services is also available for purchase through the Select Plus\\nprogram, and subscriptions are generally structured with terms between one and three years. \\n In July 2014, we announced the retirement\\nover a two-year period of Select Plus agreements for commercial customers, in favor of modern licensing options. Beginning July 2015, no new Select Plus agreements were signed with commercial organizations, and customers who want to purchase\\nlicenses were encouraged to transition to the MPSA. Starting in July 2016, we will no longer be accepting orders from commercial organizations for Select Plus after their next agreement anniversary. We expect the entire Select Plus business to\\ntransition to the MPSA within a few years. \\n Open Licensing \\n Designed primarily for small- and medium-sized organizations, the Open programs allow customers to acquire perpetual or subscription licenses and, at the customer\\u2019s election, rights to future versions of\\nsoftware products over a specified time period (generally two or three years depending on the specific programs used). The Open programs have several variations to fit customers\\u2019 diverse ways of purchasing. Under the Open License program,\\ncustomers can acquire licenses only or licenses with Software Assurance, and/or renew Software Assurance upon the expiration of other existing volume licensing agreements. Under the Open Value and Open Value Subscription programs, customers can\\nacquire perpetual or subscription licenses, respectively, over a three-year period. Online services are available in each of the Open programs. \\n\\nCustomer Licensing Programs \\u2014 Online Services Only \\n Microsoft Online Subscription Agreement is designed to enable small and medium-sized businesses to easily purchase Microsoft Online Services. The program allows customers to acquire monthly or annual subscriptions\\nfor cloud-based services. \\n\\n \\u00a0\\n 14 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\u00a0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n PART I \\n Item 1 \\n \\u00a0\\n\\n Partner Programs \\n The Microsoft Cloud Solution Provider program enables partners to directly manage their entire Microsoft cloud customer lifecycle. Partners in this program use dedicated tools to directly provision, manage, and\\nsupport their customer subscriptions. Partners can easily package their own tools, products, and services, and combine them into one monthly or annual customer bill. \\n The Microsoft Services Provider License Agreement is a program targeted at service providers and independent software vendors allowing these partners to provide software services and hosted applications to their\\nend customers. Agreements are generally structured with a three-year term, and partners are billed monthly based upon consumption. \\n The\\nMicrosoft Online Services Reseller Agreement is a program that enables partners to package Microsoft online services with the partners\\u2019 services. \\n The Independent Software Vendor Royalty program enables partners to use Microsoft software in their own software programs. \\n CUSTOMERS \\n Our customers include individual consumers, small- and medium-sized organizations,\\nlarge global enterprises, public sector institutions, Internet service providers, application developers, and OEMs. No sales to an individual customer accounted for more than 10% of revenue in fiscal years 2016, 2015, or 2014. Our practice is to\\nship our products promptly upon receipt of purchase orders from customers; consequently, backlog is not significant. \\n [bookmark: tx187868_2]\\nEXECUTIVE OFFICERS OF THE REGISTRANT \\n Our executive officers as of July\\u00a028, 2016 were as follows: \\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\tName\\t\\u00a0\\u00a0\\tAge\\t\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\u00a0\\tPosition with the Company\\n\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t Satya\\u00a0Nadella\\n\\t\\u00a0\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\t48\\t\\u00a0\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\u00a0\\tChief Executive Officer\\n\\t Christopher\\u00a0C.\\u00a0Capossela\\n\\t\\u00a0\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\t46\\t\\u00a0\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\u00a0\\tExecutive Vice President, Chief Marketing Officer\\n\\t Jean-Philippe Courtois\\n\\t\\u00a0\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\t55\\t\\u00a0\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\u00a0\\tExecutive Vice President and President, Microsoft Global Sales, Marketing and Operations\\n\\t Kathleen T.

Barriers to entry in many of our businesses are low and many of the areas in which we compete evolve rapidly with changing and\\ndisruptive technologies, shifting user needs, and frequent introductions of new products and services. Our ability to remain competitive depends on our success in making innovative products, devices, and services that appeal to businesses and\\nconsumers. \\n Competition among platforms, ecosystems, and devices \\n An important element of our business model has been to create platform-based ecosystems on which many participants can build diverse solutions. A well-established ecosystem creates beneficial network effects among\\nusers, application developers, and the platform provider that can accelerate growth. Establishing significant scale in the marketplace is necessary to achieve and maintain attractive margins. We face significant competition from firms that provide\\ncompeting platforms, applications, and services. \\n \\u00a0\\n\\n\\t\\u00a0\\t\\u2022\\t\\u00a0\\t A competing vertically-integrated model, in which a single firm controls the software and hardware elements of a product and related services, has succeeded\\nwith some consumer products such as personal computers, tablets, phones, gaming consoles, and wearables. Competitors pursuing this model also earn revenue from services integrated with the hardware and software platform. We also offer some\\nvertically-integrated hardware and software products and services. To the extent we shift a portion of our business to a vertically integrated model we increase our cost of revenue and reduce our operating margins. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\t\\u00a0\\t\\u2022\\t\\u00a0\\t We derive substantial revenue from licenses of Windows operating systems on personal computers. We face significant competition from competing platforms\\ndeveloped for new devices and form factors such as smartphones and tablet computers. These devices compete on multiple bases including price and the perceived utility of the device and its platform. Users are increasingly turning to these devices to\\nperform functions that in the past were performed by personal computers. Even if many users view these devices as complementary to a personal computer, the prevalence of these devices may make it more difficult to\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\u00a0\\n 17 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\u00a0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n PART I \\n Item 1A \\n \\u00a0\\n\\n\\n\\t\\u00a0\\t \\nattract application developers to our PC operating system platforms. Competing with operating systems licensed at low or no cost may decrease our PC operating system margins. In addition, some of\\nour devices compete with products made by our OEM partners, which may affect their commitment to our platform. \\n\\n\\n \\u00a0\\n\\n\\t\\u00a0\\t\\u2022\\t\\u00a0\\t Competing platforms have application marketplaces (sometimes referred to as \\u201cstores\\u201d) with scale and significant installed bases. The variety and\\nutility of applications available on a platform are important to device purchasing decisions. Users incur costs to move data and buy new applications when switching platforms. To compete, we must successfully\\u00a0enlist developers to write\\napplications for our marketplace and ensure that these applications have high quality, customer appeal, and value. Efforts to compete with competitors\\u2019 application marketplaces may increase our cost of revenue and lower our operating margins.\\n\\n\\n\\n Business model competition \\n Companies compete with us based on a growing variety of business models. \\n \\u00a0\\n\\n\\t\\u00a0\\t\\u2022\\t\\u00a0\\t Even as we transition to a mobile-first and cloud-first strategy, the license-based proprietary software model generates most of our software revenue. We bear\\nthe costs of converting original ideas into software products through investments in research and development, offsetting these costs with the revenue received from licensing our products. Many of our competitors also develop and sell software to\\nbusinesses and consumers under this model. \\n\\n\\n \\u00a0\\n\\n\\t\\u00a0\\t\\u2022\\t\\u00a0\\t Other competitors develop and offer free applications, online services and content, and make money by selling third-party advertising. Advertising revenue\\nfunds development of products and services these competitors provide to users at no or little cost, competing directly with our revenue-generating products. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\t\\u00a0\\t\\u2022\\t\\u00a0\\t Some companies compete with us using an open source business model by modifying and then distributing open source software at nominal cost to end-users, and\\nearning revenue on advertising or complementary services and products. These firms do not bear the full costs of research and development for the software. Some open source software vendors develop software that mimics the features and functionality\\nof our products. \\n\\n\\n The competitive pressures described above may cause decreased sales volumes, price reductions,\\nand/or increased operating costs, such as for research and development, marketing, and sales incentives. This may lead to lower revenue, gross margins, and operating income. \\n Our increasing focus on services presents execution and competitive risks.\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0A growing part of our business involves cloud-based services available across the spectrum of computing\\ndevices. Our strategic vision is to compete and grow as a productivity and platform company for the mobile-first and cloud-first world. At the same time, our competitors are rapidly developing and deploying cloud-based services for consumers and\\nbusiness customers. Pricing and delivery models are evolving. Devices and form factors influence how users access services in the cloud and sometimes the user\\u2019s choice of which suite of cloud-based services to use. We are devoting significant\\nresources to develop and deploy our cloud-based strategies. The Windows ecosystem must continue to evolve with this changing environment. We are undertaking cultural and organizational changes to drive accountability and eliminate obstacles to\\ninnovation. The Company\\u2019s increasing reliance on data-driven insights is becoming more important to the success of key opportunities in monetization, customer perceptions of quality, and operational efficiency. Besides software development\\ncosts, we are incurring costs to build and maintain infrastructure to support cloud computing services. These costs will reduce the operating margins we have previously achieved. Whether we succeed in cloud-based services depends on our execution in\\nseveral areas, including: \\n \\u00a0\\n\\n\\t\\u00a0\\t\\u2022\\t\\u00a0\\t Continuing to bring to market compelling cloud-based experiences that generate increasing traffic and market share. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\t\\u00a0\\t\\u2022\\t\\u00a0\\t Maintaining the utility, compatibility, and performance of our cloud-based services on the growing array of computing devices, including PCs, smartphones,\\ntablets, gaming consoles, and other television-related devices. \\n\\n\\n \\u00a0\\n\\n\\t\\u00a0\\t\\u2022\\t\\u00a0\\t Continuing to enhance the attractiveness of our cloud platforms to third-party developers. \\n\\n\\n\\n \\u00a0\\n 18 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\u00a0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n PART I \\n Item 1A \\n \\u00a0\\n\\n\\n\\t\\u00a0\\t\\u2022\\t\\u00a0\\t Ensuring our cloud-based services meet the reliability expectations of our customers and maintain the security of their data. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\t\\u00a0\\t\\u2022\\t\\u00a0\\t Making our suite of cloud-based services platform-agnostic, available on a wide range of devices and ecosystems, including those of our competitors.\\n\\n\\n\\n It is uncertain whether our strategies will attract the users or generate the revenue required to succeed. If we are\\nnot effective in executing organizational and technical changes to increase efficiency and accelerate innovation, or if we fail to generate sufficient usage of our new products and services, we may not grow revenue in line with the infrastructure\\nand development investments described above. This may negatively impact gross margins and operating income. \\n We make significant\\ninvestments in new products and services that may not achieve expected returns.\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0We will continue to make significant investments in research, development, and marketing for existing products, services, and technologies,\\nincluding the Windows operating system, the Microsoft Office system, Bing, Windows Phone, Windows Server, the Windows Store, the Microsoft Azure Services platform, Office 365, other cloud-based offerings, and the Xbox entertainment platform. We also\\ninvest in the development and acquisition of a variety of hardware for productivity, communication, and entertainment including PCs, tablets, phones, and gaming devices. Investments in new technology are speculative. Commercial success depends on\\nmany factors, including innovativeness, developer support, and effective distribution and marketing. If customers do not perceive our latest offerings as providing significant new functionality or other value, they may reduce their purchases of new\\nsoftware and hardware products or upgrades, unfavorably affecting revenue. We may not achieve significant revenue from new product, service, and distribution channel investments for several years, if at all. New products and services may not be\\nprofitable, and even if they are profitable, operating margins for some new products and businesses will not be as high as the margins we have experienced historically. \\n The launch of Windows 10, with free upgrades available to existing users of Windows 7 and 8.1, constitutes the most ambitious update effort we have ever undertaken. We have done extensive preparation and\\ncompatibility testing for applications and devices to help ensure a positive experience for our users installing Windows 10. However, if users have a negative upgrade experience, or the community reacts negatively to the process we are following to\\npromote and undertake the upgrades, the reception of Windows\\u00a010 in the marketplace may be harmed, and customers or government agencies may bring litigation or regulatory actions.\\u00a0In addition, we anticipate that Windows\\u00a010 will enable\\nnew post-license monetization opportunities beyond initial license revenues.\\u00a0Our failure to realize these opportunities to the extent we expect could have an adverse impact on our revenues. Finally, our practices around data collection, use,\\nand management in Windows 10 could result in regulatory review and decisions directing us to change these practices and imposing fines. If so, we could face negative public reaction, degraded user experiences, and reduced flexibility in product\\ndesign. \\n Developing new technologies is complex. It can require long development and testing periods. Significant delays in new releases\\nor significant problems in creating new products or services could adversely affect our revenue. \\n Acquisitions, joint ventures, and\\nstrategic alliances may have an adverse effect on our business.\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0We expect to continue making acquisitions and entering into joint ventures and strategic alliances as part of our long-term business strategy. In June 2016,\\nwe announced our acquisition of LinkedIn for approximately $26.2 billion. The LinkedIn acquisition and other transactions and arrangements involve significant challenges and risks, including that they do not advance our business strategy, that we\\nget an unsatisfactory return on our investment, that we have difficulty integrating new employees, business systems, and technology, or that they distract management from our other businesses. If an arrangement fails to adequately anticipate\\nchanging circumstances and interests of a party, it may result in early termination or renegotiation of the arrangement. The success of these transactions and arrangements will depend in part on our ability to leverage them to enhance our existing\\nproducts and services or develop compelling new ones. It may take longer than expected to realize the full benefits from these transactions and arrangements, such as increased revenue, enhanced efficiencies, or increased market share, or the\\nbenefits may ultimately be smaller than we expected. These events could adversely affect our operating results or financial condition. \\n\\n \\u00a0\\n 19 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\u00a0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n PART I \\n Item 1A \\n \\u00a0\\n\\n If our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets become impaired, we may be required to record\\na significant charge to earnings.\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0We acquire other companies and intangible assets and may not realize all the economic benefit from those acquisitions, which could cause an impairment of goodwill or intangibles. We review\\nour amortizable intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. We test goodwill for impairment at least annually. Factors that may be a change in circumstances, indicating\\nthat the carrying value of our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets may not be recoverable, include a decline in our stock price and market capitalization, reduced future cash flow estimates, and slower growth rates in industry segments in\\nwhich we participate. We may be required to record a significant charge on our consolidated financial statements during the period in which any impairment of our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets is determined, negatively affecting our\\nresults of operations. For example, in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2015, we recorded a $5.1 billion charge for the impairment of goodwill and a $2.2 billion charge for the impairment of intangible assets, and in the fourth quarter of fiscal\\nyear 2016 we recorded a $480 million charge for the impairment of intangible assets. The impairment charges for both periods related to our phone business. Our acquisition of LinkedIn will result in a significant increase in our goodwill and\\nintangible asset balances. \\n We may not earn the revenues we expect from our intellectual property rights. \\n\\nWe may not be able to adequately protect our intellectual property rights \\n Protecting our global intellectual property rights and combating unlicensed copying and use of our software and other intellectual property is difficult. While piracy adversely affects U.S. revenue, the impact on\\nrevenue from outside the U.S. is more significant, particularly in countries where laws are less protective of intellectual property rights. Our revenue in these markets may grow slower than the underlying device market. Similarly, the absence of\\nharmonized patent laws makes it more difficult to ensure consistent respect for patent rights. Throughout the world, we educate consumers about the benefits of licensing genuine products and obtaining indemnification benefits for intellectual\\nproperty risks, and we educate lawmakers about the advantages of a business climate where intellectual property rights are protected. Reductions in the legal protection for software intellectual property rights could adversely affect revenue.\\n\\n We may not receive expected royalties from our patent licenses \\n We expend significant resources to patent the intellectual property we create with the expectation that we will generate revenues by incorporating that intellectual property in our products or services or, in some\\ninstances, by licensing our patents to others in return for a royalty.\\u00a0Changes in the law may weaken our ability to prevent the use of patented technology or collect revenue for licensing our patents.\\u00a0These include legislative changes and\\nregulatory actions that make it more difficult to obtain injunctions, and the increasing use of legal process to challenge issued patents. Similarly, licensees of our patents may fail to satisfy their obligations to pay us royalties, or may contest\\nthe scope and extent of their obligations. Finally, the royalties we can obtain to monetize our intellectual property may decline because of the evolution of technology, selling price changes in products using licensed patents, or the difficulty of\\ndiscovering infringements. \\n Third parties may claim we infringe their intellectual property rights.\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0From\\ntime to time, others claim we infringe their intellectual property rights. The number of these claims may grow because of constant technological change in the markets in which we compete, the extensive patent coverage of existing technologies, the\\nrapid rate of issuance of new patents, and our offering of first-party devices, such as Surface and Lumia phones. To resolve these claims, we may enter into royalty and licensing agreements on terms that are less favorable than currently available,\\nstop selling or redesign affected products or services, or pay damages to satisfy indemnification commitments with our customers. These outcomes may cause operating margins to decline. Besides money damages, in some jurisdictions plaintiffs can seek\\ninjunctive relief that may limit or prevent importing, marketing, and selling our products or services that have infringing technologies. In some countries, such as Germany, an injunction can be issued before the parties have fully litigated the\\nvalidity of the underlying patents. We have paid significant amounts to settle claims related to the use of technology and intellectual property rights and to procure intellectual property rights as part of our strategy to manage this risk, and may\\ncontinue to do so. \\n\\n \\u00a0\\n 20 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\u00a0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n PART I \\n Item 1A \\n \\u00a0\\n\\n We may not be able to protect our source code from copying if there is an unauthorized\\ndisclosure of source code.\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0Source code, the detailed program commands for our operating systems and other software programs, is critical to our business. Although we license portions of our application and operating system\\nsource code to several licensees, we take significant measures to protect the secrecy of large portions of our source code. If a significant portion of our source code leaks, we might lose future trade secret protection for that source code. It may\\nbecome easier for third parties to compete with our products by copying functionality, which could adversely affect our revenue and operating margins. Unauthorized disclosure of source code also could increase the security risks described in the\\nnext paragraph. \\n Cyber-attacks and security vulnerabilities could lead to reduced revenue, increased costs, liability claims, or harm to our\\ncompetitive position. \\n Security of Microsoft\\u2019s information technology \\n\\nThreats to IT security can take a variety of forms. Individual and groups of hackers, and sophisticated organizations including state-sponsored\\norganizations or nation-states themselves, may take steps that pose threats to our customers and our IT.\\u00a0These actors may use a wide variety of methods, which may include developing and deploying malicious software to attack our products and\\nservices and gain access to our networks and datacenters, using social engineering techniques, or acting in a coordinated manner to launch distributed denial of service or other coordinated attacks. Cyber threats are constantly evolving, thereby\\nincreasing the difficulty of detecting and successfully defending against them. Cyber threats can have cascading impacts that unfold with increasing speed across our internal networks and systems and those of our partners and customers. Breaches of\\nour network or data security could disrupt the security of our internal systems and business applications, impair our ability to provide services to our customers and protect the privacy of their data, result in product development delays,\\ncompromise confidential or technical business information harming our competitive position, result in theft or misuse of our intellectual property or other assets, require us to allocate more resources to improved technologies, or otherwise\\nadversely affect our business. \\n In addition, our internal IT environment continues to evolve. Often we are early adopters of new devices\\nand technologies. We embrace new ways of sharing data and communicating internally and with partners and customers using methods such as social networking and other consumer-oriented technologies. Our business policies and internal security controls\\nmay not keep pace with these changes as new threats emerge. \\n Security of our products, services, devices, and customers\\u2019 data \\n\\nSecurity threats are a particular challenge to companies like us whose business is technology products and services. Threats to our own IT\\ninfrastructure can also affect our customers. Customers using our cloud-based services rely on the security of our infrastructure to ensure the reliability of our services and the protection of their data. Hackers tend to focus their efforts on the\\nmost popular operating systems, programs, and services, including many of ours, and we expect that to continue. The security of our products and services is important in our customers\\u2019 purchasing decisions. \\n\\nTo defend against security threats, both to our internal IT systems and those of our customers, we must continuously engineer more secure products\\nand services, enhance security and reliability features, improve the deployment of software updates to address security vulnerabilities, develop mitigation technologies that help to secure customers from attacks even when software updates are not\\ndeployed, maintain the digital security infrastructure that protects the integrity of our network, products, and services, and provide customers security tools such as firewalls and anti-virus software. \\n\\nThe cost of these steps could reduce our operating margins. If we fail to do these things well, actual or perceived security vulnerabilities in our\\nproducts and services could harm our reputation and lead customers to reduce or delay future purchases of products or subscriptions to services, or to use competing products or services. Customers may also spend more on protecting their existing\\ncomputer systems from attack, which could delay adoption of additional \\n\\n \\u00a0\\n 21 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\u00a0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n PART I \\n Item 1A \\n \\u00a0\\n\\n \\nproducts or services. Customers may fail to update their systems, continue to run software or operating systems we no longer support, or may fail timely to install security patches. Any of these\\nactions by customers could adversely affect our revenue. Actual or perceived vulnerabilities may lead to claims against us. Although our license agreements typically contain provisions that eliminate or limit our exposure to liability, there is no\\nassurance these provisions will withstand legal challenges. Legislative or regulatory action in these areas may increase the costs to develop, implement, or secure our products and services. \\n\\nDisclosure of personal data could cause liability and harm our reputation.\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0As we continue to grow the number and\\nscale of our cloud-based offerings, we store and process increasingly large amounts of personally identifiable information of our customers. The continued occurrence of high-profile data breaches provides evidence of an external environment\\nincreasingly hostile to information security. Despite our efforts to improve the security controls across our business groups and geographies, it is possible our security controls over personal data, our training of employees and vendors on data\\nsecurity, and other practices we follow may not prevent the improper disclosure of customer data we or our vendors store and manage. Improper disclosure could harm our reputation, lead to legal exposure to customers, or subject us to liability under\\nlaws that protect personal data, resulting in increased costs or loss of revenue. Our software products and services also enable our customers to store and process personal data on-premises or, increasingly, in a cloud-based environment we host.\\nGovernment authorities can sometimes require us to produce customer data in response to valid legal orders. In the U.S. and elsewhere, we advocate for transparency concerning these requests and appropriate limitations on government authority to\\ncompel disclosure. Despite our efforts to protect customer data, perceptions that the collection, use and retention of personal information is not satisfactorily protected could inhibit sales of our products or services, and could limit adoption of\\nour cloud-based solutions by consumers, businesses, and government entities. Additional security measures we may take to address customer concerns, or constraints on our flexibility to determine where and how to operate datacenters in response to\\ncustomer expectations or governmental rules or actions, may cause higher operating expenses. \\n We may have outages, data losses, and\\ndisruptions of our online services if we fail to maintain an adequate operations infrastructure.\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0Our increasing user traffic, growth in services, and the complexity of our products and services demand more computing power.\\nWe spend substantial amounts to build, purchase, or lease datacenters and equipment and to upgrade our technology and network infrastructure to handle more traffic on our websites and in our datacenters. These demands continue to increase as we\\nintroduce new products and services and support the growth of existing services such as Bing, Exchange Online, Office 365, SharePoint Online, OneDrive, Skype, Xbox Live, Microsoft Azure, Outlook.com, Windows Stores, and Microsoft Account services.\\nWe are rapidly growing our business of providing a platform and back-end hosting for services provided by third parties to their end users. Maintaining, securing, and expanding this infrastructure is expensive and complex. It requires that we\\nmaintain an Internet connectivity infrastructure that is robust and reliable within competitive and regulatory constraints that continue to evolve. Inefficiencies or operational failures, including temporary or permanent loss of customer data or\\ninsufficient Internet connectivity, could diminish the quality of our products, services, and user experience resulting in contractual liability, claims by customers and other third parties, damage to our reputation and loss of current and potential\\nusers, subscribers, and advertisers, each of which may harm our operating results and financial condition. \\n Government litigation and\\nregulatory activity relating to competition rules may limit how we design and market our products.\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0As a leading global software and device maker, we are closely scrutinized by government agencies under U.S. and foreign\\ncompetition laws. An increasing number of governments are regulating competition law activities and this includes increased scrutiny in potentially large markets such as the European Union (\\u201cEU\\u201d), the U.S., and China. Some jurisdictions\\nalso allow competitors or consumers to assert claims of anti-competitive conduct. U.S. federal and state antitrust authorities have previously brought enforcement actions and continue to scrutinize our business. \\n\\nThe European Commission (\\u201cthe Commission\\u201d) closely scrutinizes the design of high-volume Microsoft products and the terms on which we\\nmake certain technologies used in these products, such as file formats, programming interfaces, and protocols, available to other companies. Flagship product releases such as Windows 10 can receive significant scrutiny under competition laws. For\\nexample, in 2004, the Commission ordered us to create new versions of our Windows operating system that do not include certain multimedia technologies and to provide our \\n\\n \\u00a0\\n 22 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\u00a0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n PART I \\n Item 1A \\n \\u00a0\\n\\n \\ncompetitors with specifications for how to implement certain proprietary Windows communications protocols in their own products. In 2009, the Commission accepted a set of commitments offered by\\nMicrosoft to address the Commission\\u2019s concerns relating to competition in web browsing software, including an undertaking to address Commission concerns relating to interoperability. The web browsing commitments expired in 2014. The remaining\\nobligations may limit our ability to innovate in Windows or other products in the future, diminish the developer appeal of the Windows platform, and increase our product development costs. The availability of licenses related to protocols and file\\nformats may enable competitors to develop software products that better mimic the functionality of our products, which could hamper sales of our\\u00a0products. \\n Our portfolio of first-party devices continues to grow; at the same time our OEM partners offer a large variety of devices on our platforms. As a result, increasingly we both cooperate and compete with our OEM\\npartners, creating a risk that we fail to do so in compliance with competition rules. Regulatory scrutiny in this area may increase. Certain foreign governments, particularly in China and other countries in Asia, have advanced arguments under their\\ncompetition laws that exert downward pressure on royalties for our intellectual property. Because these jurisdictions only recently implemented competition laws, their enforcement activities are unpredictable. \\n\\nGovernment regulatory actions and court decisions such as these may hinder our ability to provide the benefits of our software to consumers and\\nbusinesses, reducing the attractiveness of our products and the revenue that come from them. New competition law actions could be initiated. The outcome of such actions, or steps taken to avoid them, could adversely affect us in a variety of ways,\\nincluding: \\n \\u00a0\\n\\n\\t\\u00a0\\t\\u2022\\t\\u00a0\\t We may have to choose between withdrawing products from certain geographies to avoid fines or designing and developing alternative versions of those products\\nto comply with government rulings, which may entail a delay in a product release and removing functionality that customers want or on which developers rely. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\t\\u00a0\\t\\u2022\\t\\u00a0\\t We may be required to make available licenses to our proprietary technologies on terms that do not reflect their fair market value or do not protect our\\nassociated intellectual property. \\n\\n\\n \\u00a0\\n\\n\\t\\u00a0\\t\\u2022\\t\\u00a0\\t The rulings described above may be precedent in other competition law proceedings. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\t\\u00a0\\t\\u2022\\t\\u00a0\\t We are subject to a variety of ongoing commitments because of court or administrative orders, consent decrees, or other voluntary actions we have taken. If we\\nfail to comply with these commitments, we may incur litigation costs and be subject to substantial fines or other remedial actions. \\n\\n\\n \\u00a0\\n\\n\\t\\u00a0\\t\\u2022\\t\\u00a0\\t Our ability to realize anticipated Windows 10 post-sale monetization opportunities may be limited. \\n\\n\\n\\nOur global operations subject us to potential liability under anti-corruption, trade protection, and other laws and\\nregulations.\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other anti-corruption laws and regulations (\\u201cAnti-Corruption Laws\\u201d) prohibit corrupt payments by our employees, vendors, or agents. From time to time, we receive\\ninquiries from authorities in the U.S. and elsewhere and reports from employees and others about our business activities outside the U.S. and our compliance with Anti-Corruption Laws. Specifically, we have been cooperating with authorities in the US\\nin connection with reports concerning our compliance with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act in various countries. While we devote substantial resources to our global compliance programs and have implemented policies, training, and internal controls\\ndesigned to reduce the risk of corrupt payments, our employees, vendors, or agents may violate our policies. Our failure to comply with Anti-Corruption Laws could result in significant fines and penalties, criminal sanctions against us, our\\nofficers, or our employees, prohibitions on the conduct of our business, and damage to our reputation. Geopolitical instability may lead to sanctions and impact our ability to do business in some geographies. Operations outside the U.S. may be\\naffected by changes in trade protection laws, policies, and measures, sanctions, and other regulatory requirements affecting trade and investment. We may be subject to legal liability and reputational damage if we sell goods or services in violation\\nof U.S. trade sanctions on countries such as Iran, North Korea, Cuba, Sudan, and Syria. \\n Other regulatory areas that may apply to our\\nproducts and online services offerings include user privacy, telecommunications, data storage and protection, and online content. For example, regulators may take the position that our offerings such as Skype are covered by laws regulating\\ntelecommunications services. Applying these laws and regulations to our business is often unclear, subject to change over time, and sometimes may conflict from \\n\\n \\u00a0\\n 23 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\u00a0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n PART I \\n Item 1A \\n \\u00a0\\n\\n \\njurisdiction to jurisdiction. Additionally, these laws and governments\\u2019 approach to their enforcement, and our products and services, are continuing to evolve. Compliance with these types of\\nregulation may involve significant costs or require changes in products or business practices that result in reduced revenue. Noncompliance could result in the imposition of penalties or orders we stop the alleged noncompliant activity. \\n\\nLaws and regulations relating to the handling of personal data may impede the adoption of our services or result in increased costs, legal\\nclaims, or fines against us.\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0The growth of our internet- and cloud-based services internationally relies increasingly on the movement of data across national boundaries. Legal requirements relating to the collection,\\nstorage, handling, and transfer of personal data continue to evolve. For example, in October 2015 the European Court of Justice (\\u201cECJ\\u201d) invalidated the EU/U.S. safe harbor framework, in place since 2000, that enabled companies to transfer\\ndata from EU member states to the U.S. Although other legally-recognized methods to enable data transfers currently remain valid, the reasoning of the ECJ striking down the safe harbor framework could be used to challenge those methods in future\\ncomplaints. There is a recognized need for a new regulatory safe harbor framework that will also support other methods of data transfer between the EU and U.S. Outcomes may include a new trans-Atlantic data transfer agreement, a new EU data\\nprotection directive, or a range of legal requirements adopted by individual EU member states, or no action at all. One or more of these outcomes may result in burdensome or inconsistent requirements affecting the location and movement of our\\ncustomer and internal employee data as well as the management of that data. Compliance may require changes in services, business practices, or internal systems that result in increased costs, lower revenue, reduced efficiency, or greater difficulty\\nin competing with foreign-based firms. Failure to comply with existing or new rules may result in significant penalties or orders to stop the alleged noncompliant activity. \\n Our business depends on our ability to attract and retain talented employees.\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0Our business is based on successfully attracting and retaining talented employees. The market for highly\\nskilled workers and leaders in our industry is extremely competitive. We are limited in our ability to recruit internationally by restrictive domestic immigration laws. If we are less successful in our recruiting efforts, or if we cannot retain key\\nemployees, our ability to develop and deliver successful products and services may be adversely affected. Effective succession planning is also important to our long-term success. Failure to ensure effective transfer of knowledge and smooth\\ntransitions involving key employees could hinder our strategic planning and execution. How employment-related laws are interpreted and applied to our workforce practices may result in increased operating costs and less flexibility in how we meet our\\nworkforce needs. \\n We have claims and lawsuits against us that may result in adverse outcomes.\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0We are\\nsubject to a variety of claims and lawsuits. These claims may arise from a wide variety of business practices and initiatives, including major new product releases such as Windows 10, significant business transactions, and employment practices.\\nAdverse outcomes in some or all of these claims may result in significant monetary damages or injunctive relief that could adversely affect our ability to conduct our business. The litigation and other claims are subject to inherent uncertainties\\nand management\\u2019s view of these matters may change in the future. A material adverse impact on our consolidated financial statements could occur for the period in which the effect of an unfavorable final outcome becomes probable and reasonably\\nestimable. \\n We may have additional tax liabilities.\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0We are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and many\\nforeign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes. In the ordinary course of our business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain.\\nWe regularly are under audit by tax authorities in different jurisdictions. Economic\\u00a0and political\\u00a0pressures to increase tax revenue in various jurisdictions may make resolving tax disputes favorably more difficult. Although we believe our\\ntax estimates are reasonable, the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation in the jurisdictions where we are subject to taxation could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals. The results of\\nan audit or litigation could have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements in the period or periods in which that determination is made. \\n We earn a significant amount of our operating income from outside the U.S., and any repatriation of funds currently held in foreign jurisdictions to the U.S. may result in higher effective tax rates for the\\ncompany. In addition, there have been proposals from Congress to change U.S. tax laws that would significantly impact how U.S. multinational corporations are taxed on foreign earnings. Although we cannot predict whether or in what form any proposed\\nlegislation may pass, if enacted, it could have a material adverse impact on our tax expense and cash flows. \\n\\n \\u00a0\\n 24 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\u00a0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n PART I \\n Item 1A \\n \\u00a0\\n\\n Our hardware and software products may experience quality or supply\\nproblems.\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0Our vertically-integrated hardware products such as Xbox consoles, Surface devices, phones, and other devices we design, manufacture, and market are highly complex and can have defects in design, manufacture, or\\nassociated software. We could incur significant expenses, lost revenue, and reputational harm if we fail to detect or address such issues through design, testing, or warranty repairs. We acquire some device components from sole suppliers. Our\\ncompetitors use some of the same suppliers and their demand for hardware components can affect the capacity available to us. If a component from a sole-source supplier is delayed or becomes unavailable, whether because of supplier capacity\\nconstraint or industry shortages, we may not obtain timely replacement supplies, resulting in reduced sales. Component shortages, excess or obsolete inventory, or price reductions resulting in inventory adjustments may increase our cost of revenue.\\nXbox consoles, Surface devices, phones, and other hardware are assembled in Asia and other geographies that may be subject to disruptions in the supply chain, resulting in shortages that would affect our revenue and operating margins. These same\\nrisks would apply to any other vertically-integrated hardware and software products we may offer. \\n Our software products also may\\nexperience quality or reliability problems. The highly sophisticated software products we develop may contain bugs and other defects that interfere with their intended operation. Any defects we do not detect and fix in pre-release testing could\\ncause reduced sales and revenue, damage to our reputation, repair or remediation costs, delays in the release of new products or versions, or legal liability. Although our license agreements typically contain provisions that eliminate or limit our\\nexposure to liability, there is no assurance these provisions will withstand legal challenge. \\n We strive to empower all people and\\norganizations to achieve more and accessibility of our products is an important aspect of this goal. There is increasing pressure from advocacy groups, regulators, competitors, and customers to make technology more accessible. If our products do not\\nmeet customer expectations or emerging global accessibility requirements, we could lose sales opportunities or face regulatory actions. \\n\\nOur global business exposes us to operational and economic risks.\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0Our customers are located in over 200 countries and\\na significant part of our revenue comes from international sales. The global nature of our business creates operational and economic risks. Emerging markets are a significant focus of our international growth strategy. The developing nature of these\\nmarkets presents several risks, including deterioration of social, political, labor, or economic conditions in a country or region, and difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations. Although we hedge a portion of our international\\ncurrency exposure, significant fluctuations in foreign exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and foreign currencies may adversely affect our revenue. Competitive or regulatory pressure to make our pricing structure uniform might require that we\\nreduce the sales price of our software in the U.S. and other countries. \\n Catastrophic events or geopolitical conditions may disrupt\\nour business.\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0A disruption or failure of our systems or operations because of a major earthquake, weather event, cyber-attack, terrorist attack, or other catastrophic event could cause delays in completing sales, providing\\nservices, or performing other critical functions. Our corporate headquarters, a significant portion of our research and development activities, and certain other essential business operations are in the Seattle, Washington area, and we have other\\nbusiness operations in the Silicon Valley area of California, both of which are seismically active regions. A catastrophic event that results in the destruction or disruption of any of our critical business or IT systems could harm our ability to\\nconduct normal business operations. Providing our customers with more services and solutions in the cloud puts a premium on the resilience of our systems and strength of our business continuity management plans, and magnifies the potential impact of\\nprolonged service outages on our operating results. \\n Abrupt political change, terrorist activity, and armed conflict pose a risk of\\ngeneral economic disruption in affected countries, which may increase our operating costs. These conditions also may add uncertainty to the timing and budget for technology investment decisions by our customers, and may cause supply chain\\ndisruptions for hardware manufacturers, either of which may adversely affect our revenue. The long-term effects of climate change on the global economy or the IT industry in particular are unclear. Environmental regulations or changes in the supply,\\ndemand or available sources of energy or other natural resources may affect the availability or cost of goods and services, including natural resources, necessary to run our business. Changes in weather where we operate may increase the costs of\\npowering and cooling computer hardware we use to develop software and provide cloud-based services. \\n\\n \\u00a0\\n 25 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\u00a0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n PART I \\n Item 1A, 1B, 2 \\n \\u00a0\\n\\n Adverse economic or market conditions may harm our\\nbusiness.\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0Worsening economic conditions, including inflation, recession, or other changes in economic conditions, may cause lower IT spending and adversely affect our revenue. If demand for PCs, servers, and other\\ncomputing devices declines, or consumer or business spending for those products declines, our revenue will be adversely affected. Substantial revenue comes from our U.S. government contracts. An extended federal government shutdown resulting from\\nfailing to pass budget appropriations, adopt continuing funding resolutions or raise the debt ceiling, and other budgetary decisions limiting or delaying federal government spending, could reduce government IT spending on our products and services\\nand adversely affect our revenue. \\n Our product distribution system relies on an extensive partner and retail network. OEMs building\\ndevices that run our software have also been a significant means of distribution. The impact of economic conditions on our partners, such as the bankruptcy of a major distributor, OEM, or retailer, could cause sales channel disruption. \\n\\nChallenging economic conditions also may impair the ability of our customers to pay for products and services they have purchased. As a result,\\nallowances for doubtful accounts and write-offs of accounts receivable may increase. \\n We maintain an investment portfolio of various\\nholdings, types, and maturities. These investments are subject to general credit, liquidity, market, and interest rate risks, which may be exacerbated by unusual events that affect global financial markets. A significant part of our investment\\nportfolio comprises U.S. government securities. If global credit and equity markets decline for long periods, or if there is a downgrade of the U.S. government credit rating due to an actual or threatened default on government debt, our investment\\nportfolio may be adversely affected and we could determine that more of our investments have experienced an other-than-temporary decline in fair value, requiring impairment charges that could adversely affect our financial results. \\n\\n[bookmark: tx187868_4]ITEM\\u00a01B.\\u00a0UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS \\n\\nWe have received no written comments regarding our periodic or current reports from the staff of the SEC that were issued 180 days or more\\npreceding the end of our fiscal year 2016 that remain unresolved. \\n [bookmark: tx187868_5]ITEM\\u00a02.

MD&A is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, our financial statements and the accompanying Notes to Financial Statements. \\n\\nOVERVIEW \\n Microsoft is a\\ntechnology company whose mission is to empower every person and every organization on the planet to achieve more. Our strategy is to build best-in-class platforms and productivity services for a mobile-first, cloud-first world. We develop, license,\\nand support a wide range of software products, services, and devices that deliver new opportunities, greater convenience, and enhanced value to people\\u2019s lives. \\n We generate revenue by licensing and supporting an array of software products, by offering a wide range of services, including cloud-based services to consumers and businesses, by designing, manufacturing, and\\nselling devices that integrate with our cloud-based services, and by delivering relevant online advertising to a global audience. Our most significant expenses are related to compensating employees; designing, manufacturing, marketing, and selling\\nour products and services; datacenter costs in support of our cloud-based services; and income taxes. \\n Much of our focus in fiscal year\\n2016 was toward transforming our organization to support our strategy of building best-in-class platforms and productivity services for a mobile-first, cloud-first world. We achieved product development milestones, implemented organizational\\nchanges, and made strategic and tactical moves to support the three central ambitions that support our strategy: reinventing productivity and business processes; building the intelligent cloud platform; and creating more personal computing.\\n\\n Highlights from fiscal year 2016 included: \\n \\u00a0\\n\\n\\t\\u00a0\\t\\u2022\\t\\u00a0\\t Commercial cloud annualized revenue run rate* exceeded $12.1 billion. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\t\\u00a0\\t\\u2022\\t\\u00a0\\t Office 365 Consumer subscribers increased to 23.1 million. \\n\\n\\n\\n \\u00a0\\n 29 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\u00a0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n PART II \\n Item 7 \\n \\u00a0\\n\\n\\n\\t\\u00a0\\t\\u2022\\t\\u00a0\\t Microsoft Dynamics (\\u201cDynamics\\u201d) CRM Online seat additions more than doubled year-over-year. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\t\\u00a0\\t\\u2022\\t\\u00a0\\t Microsoft Azure (\\u201cAzure\\u201d) revenue grew 113%, with usage of Azure compute and Azure SQL database more than doubling year-over-year.

We will finance the transaction primarily through the issuance of new indebtedness. The\\nMerger Agreement has been unanimously approved by the Boards of Directors of both Microsoft and LinkedIn, and we expect the acquisition will close in calendar year 2016, subject to approval by LinkedIn\\u2019s shareholders, satisfaction of certain\\nregulatory approvals, and other customary closing conditions. The acquisition is anticipated to accelerate the growth of LinkedIn, as well as Office 365 and Dynamics. \\n In May 2016, we announced the sale of our entry-level feature phone business for $350 million. The transaction is expected to close in the second half of 2016, subject to regulatory approvals and other closing\\nconditions. \\n In July 2015, we announced a plan to restructure our phone business to better focus and align resources. In May 2016, we\\nannounced plans to further streamline our smartphone hardware business. These changes in the phone business reinforce our strategy to create a vibrant Windows ecosystem with a single set of experiences across our first-party device family and\\noriginal equipment manufacturer (\\u201cOEM\\u201d) offerings. Part of this strategy involves focusing our phone devices on a narrower range of customer categories and differentiating through the combination of hardware and software we are uniquely\\npositioned to offer. As anticipated, our change in phone strategy resulted in a reduction in units sold and associated expenses in fiscal year 2016, and this trend is expected to continue in fiscal year 2017. \\n\\nIndustry Trends \\n Our industry is dynamic\\nand highly competitive, with frequent changes in both technologies and business models. Each industry shift is an opportunity to conceive new products, new technologies, or new ideas that can further transform the industry and our business. At\\nMicrosoft, we push the boundaries of what is possible through a broad range of research and development activities that seek to identify and address the changing demands of customers and users, industry trends, and competitive forces. \\n\\nEconomic Conditions, Challenges, and Risks \\n\\nThe market for software, devices, and cloud-based services is dynamic and highly competitive. Our competitors are developing new software and\\ndevices, while also deploying competing cloud-based services for consumers and businesses. The devices and form factors customers prefer evolve rapidly, and influence how users access services in the cloud, and in some cases, the user\\u2019s choice\\nof which suite of cloud-based services to use. We must continue to evolve and adapt over an extended time in pace with this changing environment. The investments we are making in devices and infrastructure will continue to increase our operating\\ncosts and may decrease our operating margins. \\n Our success is highly dependent on our ability to attract and retain qualified employees.\\nWe hire a mix of university and industry talent worldwide. Microsoft competes for talented individuals globally by offering an exceptional working environment, broad customer reach, scale in resources, the ability to grow one\\u2019s career across\\nmany different products and businesses, and competitive compensation and benefits. Aggregate demand for our software, services, and devices is correlated to global macroeconomic and geopolitical factors, which remain dynamic. \\n\\n \\u00a0\\n 30 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\u00a0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n PART II \\n Item 7 \\n \\u00a0\\n\\n Our international operations provide a significant portion of our total revenue and expenses. Many\\nof these revenue and expenses are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. As a result, changes in foreign exchange rates may significantly affect revenue and expenses. The strengthening of the U.S. dollar relative to certain foreign\\ncurrencies throughout fiscal year 2015, and continuing into fiscal year 2016, negatively impacted reported revenue and reduced reported expenses from our international operations.\\n See a discussion of these factors and other risks under Risk Factors (Part I, Item\\u00a01A of this Form 10-K). \\n\\nSeasonality \\n Our revenue historically has\\nfluctuated quarterly and has generally been highest in the second quarter of our fiscal year due to corporate calendar year-end spending trends in our major markets and holiday season spending by consumers. \\n\\nUnearned Revenue \\n Quarterly and annual revenue is impacted\\nby the deferral of revenue, primarily including: \\n \\u00a0\\n\\n\\t\\u00a0\\t\\u2022\\t\\u00a0\\t Revenue deferred on Windows 10 licenses to reflect ratable recognition over the life of the device. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\t\\u00a0\\t\\u2022\\t\\u00a0\\t Revenue deferred on bundled products and services (\\u201cBundled Offerings\\u201d). \\n\\n\\n\\nIf our customers choose to license cloud-based versions of our products and services rather than licensing transaction-based products and services,\\nthe associated revenue will shift from being recognized at the time of the transaction to being recognized over the subscription period or upon consumption, as applicable. \\n Product Revenue and Service and Other Revenue \\n Due to the growth in our cloud-based solutions,\\nservice revenue exceeded 10% of total revenue for the first time in fiscal year 2016. As a result, we have separately disclosed product revenue and service and other revenue on our consolidated income statements. \\n\\nProduct revenue includes sales from operating systems; cross-device productivity applications; server applications; business solution applications;\\ndesktop and server management tools; software development tools; video games; hardware such as PCs, tablets, gaming and entertainment consoles, phones, other intelligent devices, and related accessories; and training and certification of computer\\nsystem integrators and developers. \\n Service and other revenue includes sales from cloud-based solutions that provide customers with\\nsoftware, services, platforms, and content such as Office 365, Azure, Dynamics CRM Online, and Xbox Live; solution support; and consulting services. Service and other revenue also includes sales from online advertising. \\n\\nReportable Segments \\n The segment amounts\\nincluded in MD&A are presented on a basis consistent with our internal management reporting. Segment information appearing in Note 21 \\u2013 Segment Information and Geographic Data of the Notes to Financial Statements (Part II, Item\\u00a08 of\\nthis Form 10-K) is also presented on this basis. All differences between our internal management reporting basis and accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (\\u201cU.S. GAAP\\u201d), along with certain corporate-level and other\\nactivity, are included in Corporate and Other. \\n In June 2015, we announced a change in organizational structure to align to our\\nstrategic direction as a productivity and platform company. During the first quarter of fiscal year 2016, our chief operating decision maker, who is also our Chief Executive Officer, requested changes in the information that he regularly reviews for\\npurposes of allocating resources and assessing performance. As a result, beginning in fiscal year 2016, we report our financial performance based on our new segments, Productivity and Business Processes, Intelligent Cloud, and More Personal\\nComputing, and analyze operating income as the measure of segment profitability. We have recast certain previously reported amounts to conform to the way we internally manage and monitor segment performance. \\n\\n \\u00a0\\n 31 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\u00a0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n PART II \\n Item 7 \\n \\u00a0\\n\\n We expect to report the financial performance of LinkedIn as part of our Productivity and Business\\nProcesses segment. \\n Additional information on our reportable segments is contained in Note 21 \\u2013 Segment Information and Geographic\\nData of the Notes to Financial Statements (Part II, Item\\u00a08 of this Form 10-K). \\n SUMMARY RESULTS OF OPERATIONS \\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t(In\\u00a0millions,\\u00a0except\\u00a0percentages\\u00a0and\\u00a0per\\u00a0share\\u00a0amounts)\\t\\u00a0\\u00a0\\t2016\\t\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\t2015\\t\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\t2014\\t\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\tPercentage\\nChange\\u00a02016\\nVersus\\u00a02015\\t\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\tPercentage\\nChange\\u00a02015\\nVersus\\u00a02014\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t Revenue\\n\\t\\u00a0\\u00a0\\t$\\t\\u00a0\\u00a085,320\\t\\u00a0\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\t$\\t\\u00a0\\u00a093,580\\t\\u00a0\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\t$\\t\\u00a0\\u00a086,833\\t\\u00a0\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\t(9)%\\t\\u00a0\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\t8%\\t\\u00a0\\u00a0\\n\\t Gross margin\\n\\t\\u00a0\\u00a0\\t$\\t52,540\\t\\u00a0\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\t$\\t60,542\\t\\u00a0\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\t$\\t59,755\\t\\u00a0\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\t(13)%\\t\\u00a0\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\t1%\\t\\u00a0\\u00a0\\n\\t Operating income\\n\\t\\u00a0\\u00a0\\t$\\t20,182\\t\\u00a0\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\t$\\t18,161\\t\\u00a0\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\t$\\t27,759\\t\\u00a0\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\t11%\\t\\u00a0\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\t(35)%\\t\\u00a0\\u00a0\\n\\t Diluted earnings per share\\n\\t\\u00a0\\u00a0\\t$\\t2.10\\t\\u00a0\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\t$\\t1.48\\t\\u00a0\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\t$\\t2.63\\t\\u00a0\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\t42%\\t\\u00a0\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\t(44)%\\t\\u00a0\\u00a0\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\n\\n Fiscal year 2016 compared with fiscal year 2015 \\n Revenue decreased $8.3 billion or 9%, primarily due to the impact of the net revenue deferral from Windows 10 of $6.6 billion and an unfavorable foreign currency impact of approximately $3.8 billion or 4%. Windows\\n10 revenue is primarily recognized at the time of billing in the More Personal Computing segment, and the deferral and subsequent recognition of revenue is reflected in Corporate and Other. More Personal Computing revenue decreased, mainly due to\\nlower revenue from Devices and Windows, offset in part by higher revenue from search advertising and Gaming. Intelligent Cloud revenue increased, primarily due to higher revenue from server products and cloud services and Enterprise Services.\\nProductivity and Business Processes revenue increased slightly, driven by an increase in Office and Dynamics revenue. \\n Operating income\\nincreased $2.0 billion or 11%, primarily due to a decrease in impairment, integration, and restructuring expenses and sales and marketing expenses, offset in part by lower gross margin. Gross margin decreased $8.0 billion or 13%, driven by the\\ndecline in revenue as discussed above, and included an unfavorable foreign currency impact of approximately $3.3 billion or 5%. Productivity and Business Processes and More Personal Computing gross margin decreased, offset in part by higher gross\\nmargin from Intelligent Cloud. \\n Key changes in expenses were: \\n \\u00a0\\n\\n\\t\\u00a0\\t\\u2022\\t\\u00a0\\t Cost of revenue decreased $258 million or 1%, mainly due to a reduction in phone sales, driven by the change in strategy for the phone business, offset in\\npart by growth in commercial cloud and search advertising. \\n\\n\\n \\u00a0\\n\\n\\t\\u00a0\\t\\u2022\\t\\u00a0\\t Impairment, integration, and restructuring expenses decreased $8.9 billion, primarily driven by prior year goodwill and asset impairment charges related to\\nour phone business and restructuring charges associated with our phone business restructuring plans. \\n\\n\\n \\u00a0\\n\\n\\t\\u00a0\\t\\u2022\\t\\u00a0\\t Sales and marketing expenses decreased $1.0 billion or 6%, driven by a reduction in phone expenses and a favorable foreign currency impact of approximately\\n2%. \\n\\n\\n Diluted earnings per share (\\u201cEPS\\u201d) was $2.10 for fiscal year 2016. Current year diluted EPS was\\nnegatively impacted by the net revenue deferral from Windows 10 and impairment, integration, and restructuring expenses, which resulted in a decrease to diluted EPS of $0.69, and favorably impacted by the adoption of new accounting guidance related\\nto stock-based compensation, which resulted in an increase to diluted EPS of $0.05. Diluted EPS was $1.48 for fiscal year 2015. Prior year diluted EPS was negatively impacted by impairment, integration, and restructuring expenses, which resulted in\\na decrease to diluted EPS of $1.15. \\n\\n \\u00a0\\n 32 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\u00a0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n PART II \\n Item 7 \\n \\u00a0\\n\\n Fiscal year 2015 compared with fiscal year 2014 \\n\\nRevenue increased $6.7 billion or 8%, primarily due to higher revenue from More Personal Computing and Intelligent Cloud.

During fiscal year 2015, we recognized a net $303 million of previously deferred revenue related to Bundled Offerings. \\n\\nCorporate and Other operating loss decreased $2.0 billion, primarily due to an $8.9 billion reduction in impairment, integration, and restructuring\\nexpenses, driven by prior year goodwill and asset impairment charges related to our phone business, offset in part by lower revenue. \\n Fiscal year\\n2015 compared with fiscal year 2014 \\n Corporate and Other revenue increased $613 million, primarily due to the timing of net revenue\\ndeferrals compared to the prior year. During fiscal year 2015, we recognized a net $303 million of previously deferred revenue related to Bundled Offerings. During fiscal year 2014, we deferred a net $349 million of revenue related to Bundled\\nOfferings. \\n Corporate and Other operating loss increased $9.3 billion, primarily due to higher impairment, integration, and\\nrestructuring expenses, offset in part by increased revenue. \\n OPERATING EXPENSES \\n\\nResearch and Development \\n \\u00a0\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t(In millions, except percentages)\\t\\u00a0\\u00a0\\t2016\\t\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\t2015\\t\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\t2014\\t\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\t Percentage\\n Change\\u00a02016\\n Versus\\u00a02015\\n\\t\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\t Percentage\\n Change\\u00a02015\\n Versus\\u00a02014\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t Research and development\\n\\t\\u00a0\\u00a0\\t$\\t\\u00a0\\u00a011,988\\t\\u00a0\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\t$\\t\\u00a0\\u00a012,046\\t\\u00a0\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\t$\\t\\u00a0\\u00a011,381\\t\\u00a0\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\t0%\\t\\u00a0\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\t6%\\t\\u00a0\\u00a0\\n\\t As a percent of revenue\\n\\t\\u00a0\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\t14%\\t\\u00a0\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\t13%\\t\\u00a0\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\t13%\\t\\u00a0\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\t1ppt\\t\\u00a0\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\t0ppt\\t\\u00a0\\u00a0\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\n\\n\\n \\u00a0\\n 37 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\u00a0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n PART II \\n Item 7 \\n \\u00a0\\n\\n Research and development expenses include payroll, employee benefits, stock-based compensation\\nexpense, and other headcount-related expenses associated with product development.

Our annual goodwill impairment test as of\\nMay\\u00a01, 2015 indicated that the carrying value of our previous Phone Hardware reporting unit goodwill exceeded its estimated fair value. Accordingly, we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $5.1 billion, reducing our Phone Hardware reporting\\nunit goodwill from $5.4 billion to $116 million, net of foreign currency remeasurements, as well as an impairment charge of $2.2 billion related to the write-down of our Phone Hardware reporting unit intangible assets. All remaining goodwill and\\nintangible assets are included in our Devices reporting unit, within More Personal Computing under our current segment structure.

Other than those\\nderivatives entered into for investment purposes, such as commodity contracts, the gains (losses) are generally economically offset by unrealized gains (losses) in the underlying available-for-sale securities and gains (losses) on certain balance\\nsheet amounts from foreign exchange rate changes. \\n Fiscal year 2016 compared with fiscal year 2015 \\n\\nDividends and interest income increased due to higher portfolio balances and slightly higher yields on fixed-income securities. Interest expense\\nincreased due to higher outstanding long-term debt. Net recognized gains on investments decreased primarily due to higher other-than-temporary impairments and lower gains on sales of fixed-income securities, offset in part by higher gains on sales\\nof equity securities. Other-than-temporary impairments were $322 million in fiscal year 2016, compared with $183 million in fiscal year 2015. Net losses on derivatives increased due to higher losses on currency and equity contracts and lower gains\\non interest rate contracts in the current period as compared to the prior period, offset in part by lower losses on commodity contracts.

We supply our Windows PC operating system to customers through our U.S. regional operating center, while we supply the Microsoft Office system and our server products and tools to\\ncustomers through our foreign regional operations centers. In fiscal year 2016, our U.S. loss before income taxes was $325 million and our foreign income before income taxes was $20.1 billion. Net revenue deferrals related to sales of Windows 10\\nnegatively impacted our fiscal year 2016 U.S. loss before income taxes by $6.0 billion and foreign income before income taxes by $588 million. In fiscal year 2015, our U.S. income before income taxes was $7.4 billion and our foreign income before\\nincome taxes was $11.1 billion. Impairment, integration, and restructuring expense relating to our phone business decreased our fiscal year 2015 U.S income before income taxes by $1.1 billion and foreign income before income taxes by\\n$8.9\\u00a0billion. \\n On July\\u00a027, 2015, the U.S. Tax Court issued an opinion in Altera Corp. v. Commissioner related to the treatment\\nof stock-based compensation expense in an intercompany cost-sharing arrangement. The IRS\\u2019s decision to appeal on February\\u00a019, 2016 prolongs the uncertainty regarding the ultimate outcome of the Altera case, and we do not expect to adjust\\nour consolidated financial statements until there is a final resolution of this case. \\n Tax contingencies and other income tax\\nliabilities were $11.8 billion and $12.1 billion as of June\\u00a030, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and are included in other long-term liabilities. This decrease relates primarily to tax credits available for carryover and a partial settlement of the\\nIRS audit for tax years 2007 to 2009, offset by increases relating to intercompany transfer pricing. \\n While we settled a portion of the\\nIRS audit for tax years 2004 to 2006 during the third quarter of fiscal year 2011, and settled a portion of the IRS audit for tax years 2007 to 2009 during the first quarter of fiscal year 2016, we remain under audit for those years. In February\\n2012, the IRS withdrew its 2011 Revenue Agents Report for tax years 2004 to 2006 and reopened the audit phase of the examination. As of June\\u00a030, 2016, the primary unresolved issue relates to transfer pricing, which could have a significant\\nimpact on our consolidated financial statements if not resolved favorably. We believe our allowances for income tax contingencies are adequate. We have not received a proposed assessment for the unresolved issues and do not expect a final resolution\\nof these issues in the next 12 months.\\u00a0Based on the information currently available, we do not anticipate a significant increase or decrease to our tax contingencies for these issues within the next 12 months. We also continue to be subject to\\nexamination by the IRS for tax years 2010 to 2016. \\n We are subject to income tax in many jurisdictions outside the U.S. Our operations\\nin certain jurisdictions remain subject to examination for tax years 1996 to 2016, some of which are currently under audit by local tax authorities. The resolutions of these audits are not expected to be material to our consolidated financial\\nstatements. \\n Fiscal year 2015 compared with fiscal year 2014 \\n Our effective tax rate for fiscal years 2015 and 2014 was 34% and 21%, respectively. The fiscal year 2015 effective rate increased by 13%, primarily due to goodwill and asset impairments and restructuring charges\\nrecorded in fiscal year 2015, most of which did not generate a tax benefit. Our effective tax rate was lower than the U.S. federal statutory rate primarily due to foreign earnings taxed at lower rates resulting from producing and distributing our\\nproducts and services through our foreign regional operations centers in Ireland, Singapore, and Puerto Rico. In fiscal year 2015, this reduction was mostly offset by losses in foreign jurisdictions for which we may not realize a tax benefit,\\nprimarily as a result of impairment and restructuring charges. \\n Changes in the mix of income before income taxes between the U.S. and\\nforeign countries impacted our effective tax rate as a result of the geographic distribution of, and customer demand for, our products and services. We supply our Windows PC operating system to customers through our U.S. regional operating center,\\nwhile we supply \\n\\n \\u00a0\\n 41 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\u00a0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n PART II \\n Item 7 \\n \\u00a0\\n\\n \\nthe Microsoft Office system and our server products and tools to customers through our foreign regional operations centers. In fiscal years 2015 and 2014, our U.S. income before income taxes was\\n$7.4 billion and $7.1 billion, respectively, and comprised 40% and 26%, respectively, of our income before income taxes. In fiscal years 2015 and 2014, our foreign income before income taxes was $11.1 billion and $20.7 billion, respectively, and\\ncomprised 60% and 74%, respectively, of our income before income taxes. \\n FINANCIAL CONDITION \\n\\nCash, Cash Equivalents, and Investments \\n\\nCash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments totaled $113.2 billion as of June\\u00a030, 2016, compared with $96.5 billion as of June\\u00a030,\\n2015. Equity and other investments were $10.4 billion as of June\\u00a030, 2016, compared with $12.1 billion as of June\\u00a030, 2015. Our short-term investments are primarily intended to facilitate liquidity and for capital preservation. They\\nconsist predominantly of highly liquid investment-grade fixed-income securities, diversified among industries and individual issuers. The investments are predominantly U.S. dollar-denominated securities, but also include foreign currency-denominated\\nsecurities in order to diversify risk. Our fixed-income investments are exposed to interest rate risk and credit risk. The credit risk and average maturity of our fixed-income portfolio are managed to achieve economic returns that correlate to\\ncertain fixed-income indices. The settlement risk related to these investments is insignificant given that the short-term investments held are primarily highly liquid investment-grade fixed-income securities. \\n\\nOf the cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments as of June\\u00a030, 2016, $108.9 billion was held by our foreign subsidiaries and would\\nbe subject to material repatriation tax effects. The amount of cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments held by foreign subsidiaries subject to other restrictions on the free flow of funds (primarily currency and other local regulatory)\\nwas $2.4 billion. As of June\\u00a030, 2016, approximately 83% of the cash equivalents and short-term investments held by our foreign subsidiaries were invested in U.S. government and agency securities, approximately 4% were invested in corporate\\nnotes and bonds of U.S. companies, and approximately 5% were invested in U.S. mortgage- and asset-backed securities, all of which are denominated in U.S. dollars. The remaining cash equivalents and short-term investments held by our foreign\\nsubsidiaries were invested in foreign securities. \\n Securities lending \\n We lend certain fixed-income and equity securities to increase investment returns. The loaned securities continue to be carried as investments on our consolidated balance sheets. Cash and/or security interests are\\nreceived as collateral for the loaned securities with the amount determined based upon the underlying security lent and the creditworthiness of the borrower. Collateral received is recorded as an asset with a corresponding liability. Our securities\\nlending payable balance was $294 million as of June\\u00a030, 2016. Our average and maximum securities lending payable balances for fiscal year 2016 were $361 million and $1.2 billion, respectively. Intra-year variances in the amount of securities\\nloaned are mainly due to fluctuations in the demand for the securities. \\n Valuation \\n\\nIn general, and where applicable, we use quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities to determine the fair value of our\\nfinancial instruments. This pricing methodology applies to our Level 1 investments, such as exchange-traded mutual funds, domestic and international equities, and U.S. government securities. If quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or\\nliabilities are not available to determine fair value, then we use quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities or inputs other than the quoted prices that are observable either directly or indirectly. This pricing methodology applies to our\\nLevel 2 investments such as corporate notes and bonds, common and preferred stock, foreign government bonds, mortgage- and asset-backed securities, U.S. government and agency securities, and certificates of deposit. Level 3 investments are valued\\nusing internally developed models with unobservable inputs. Assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis using unobservable inputs are an immaterial portion of our portfolio. \\n\\n \\u00a0\\n 42 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\u00a0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n PART II \\n Item 7 \\n \\u00a0\\n\\n A majority of our investments are priced by pricing vendors and are generally Level 1 or Level 2\\ninvestments as these vendors either provide a quoted market price in an active market or use observable inputs for their pricing without applying significant adjustments. Broker pricing is used mainly when a quoted price is not available, the\\ninvestment is not priced by our pricing vendors, or when a broker price is more reflective of fair values in the market in which the investment trades. Our broker-priced investments are generally classified as Level 2 investments because the broker\\nprices these investments based on similar assets without applying significant adjustments. In addition, all of our broker-priced investments have a sufficient level of trading volume to demonstrate that the fair values used are appropriate for these\\ninvestments. Our fair value processes include controls that are designed to ensure appropriate fair values are recorded. These controls include model validation, review of key model inputs, analysis of period-over-period fluctuations, and\\nindependent recalculation of prices where appropriate. \\n Cash Flows \\n Fiscal year 2016 compared with fiscal year 2015 \\n Cash flows from operations increased $3.7\\nbillion to $33.3 billion during the fiscal year, mainly due to lower operating expenditures and a reduction in materials and production costs, offset in part by a decrease in cash received from customers. Cash used in financing decreased $1.3\\nbillion to $8.4 billion, mainly due to a $4.6 billion increase in proceeds from issuances of debt, net of repayments, offset in part by a $1.5 billion increase in cash used for common stock repurchases and a $1.1 billion increase in dividends paid.\\nCash used in investing increased $949 million to $24.0 billion, mainly due to a $2.4 billion increase in cash used for additions to property and equipment and a $1.5 billion increase in cash used for net investment purchases, sales, and maturities,\\noffset in part by a $2.3 billion decrease in cash used for acquisitions of companies, net of cash acquired, and purchases of intangibles and other assets. \\n Fiscal year 2015 compared with fiscal year 2014 \\n Cash flows from operations decreased $2.8\\nbillion to $29.7 billion, mainly due to an increase in materials and production costs in support of sales growth as well as payments related to restructuring charges and other changes in working capital, offset in part by increases in cash received\\nfrom customers. Cash used in financing increased $1.0 billion to $9.7 billion, mainly due to a $7.1 billion increase in cash used for common stock repurchases, offset in part by a $6.7 billion increase in proceeds from issuances of debt, net of\\nrepayments. Cash used in investing increased $4.2 billion to $23.0 billion, mainly due to a $5.5 billion increase in cash used for net investment purchases, sales, and maturities, partially offset by a $2.2 billion decrease in cash used for\\nacquisitions of companies, net of cash acquired, and purchases of intangible and other assets. \\n Debt \\n\\nWe issued debt to take advantage of favorable pricing and liquidity in the debt markets, reflecting our credit rating and the low interest rate\\nenvironment. The proceeds of these issuances were or will be used for general corporate purposes, which may include, among other things, funding for working capital, capital expenditures, repurchases of capital stock, acquisitions, and repayment of\\nexisting debt. See Note 12 \\u2013 Debt of the Notes to Financial Statements (Part II, Item\\u00a08 of this Form 10-K) for further discussion. \\n\\nUnearned Revenue \\n Unearned revenue as of\\nJune\\u00a030, 2016 was comprised mainly of unearned revenue from volume licensing programs. Unearned revenue from volume licensing programs represents customer billings for multi-year licensing arrangements paid for either at inception of the\\nagreement or annually at the beginning of each coverage period and accounted for as subscriptions with revenue recognized ratably over the coverage period. Unearned revenue as of June\\u00a030, 2016 also included payments for: Windows 10 licenses;\\npost-delivery support and consulting services to be performed in the future; Office 365 subscriptions; Xbox Live subscriptions; Microsoft Dynamics business solutions products; Skype prepaid credits and subscriptions; Bundled Offerings; and other\\nofferings for which we have been paid in advance and earn the revenue when we provide the service or software, or otherwise meet the revenue recognition criteria. \\n\\n \\u00a0\\n 43 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\u00a0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n PART II \\n Item 7 \\n \\u00a0\\n\\n The following table outlines the expected future recognition of unearned revenue as of\\nJune\\u00a030, 2016: \\n \\u00a0\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t(In millions)\\t\\u00a0\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t Three Months Ending,\\n\\t\\u00a0\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t September\\u00a030, 2016\\n\\t\\u00a0\\u00a0\\t$\\t10,194\\t\\u00a0\\u00a0\\n\\t December\\u00a031, 2016\\n\\t\\u00a0\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\t8,348\\t\\u00a0\\u00a0\\n\\t March\\u00a031, 2017\\n\\t\\u00a0\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\t5,868\\t\\u00a0\\u00a0\\n\\t June\\u00a030, 2017\\n\\t\\u00a0\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\t3,058\\t\\u00a0\\u00a0\\n\\t Thereafter\\n\\t\\u00a0\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\t6,441\\t\\u00a0\\u00a0\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\n\\t Total\\n\\t\\u00a0\\u00a0\\t$\\t\\u00a0\\u00a033,909\\t\\u00a0\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\u00a0\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\n\\n Share Repurchases \\n On September\\u00a016, 2013, our Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program authorizing up to $40.0 billion in share repurchases. The share repurchase program became effective on October\\u00a01, 2013,\\nhas no expiration date, and may be suspended or discontinued at any time without notice. This share repurchase program replaced the share repurchase program that was announced on September\\u00a022, 2008 and expired on September\\u00a030, 2013. As of\\nJune\\u00a030, 2016, $7.1 billion remained of our $40.0 billion share repurchase program. While the program has no expiration date, we intend to complete it by December\\u00a031, 2016. All repurchases were made using cash resources. \\n\\nDuring fiscal year 2016, we repurchased 294\\u00a0million shares of Microsoft common stock for $14.8 billion under the share repurchase program\\napproved by our Board of Directors on September\\u00a016, 2013. During fiscal year 2015, we repurchased 295\\u00a0million shares of Microsoft common stock for $13.2 billion under the share repurchase program approved by our Board of Directors on\\nSeptember\\u00a016, 2013. During fiscal year 2014, we repurchased 175\\u00a0million shares for $6.4 billion; 128\\u00a0million shares were repurchased for $4.9 billion under the share repurchase program approved by our Board of Directors on\\nSeptember\\u00a016, 2013, and 47\\u00a0million shares were repurchased for $1.5 billion under the share repurchase program that was announced on September\\u00a022, 2008 and expired September\\u00a030, 2013. \\n\\nDividends \\n See Note 18 \\u2013\\nStockholders\\u2019 Equity of the Notes to Financial Statements (Part II, Item\\u00a08 of this Form 10-K) for further discussion. \\n Off-Balance Sheet\\nArrangements \\n We provide indemnifications of varying scope and size to certain customers against claims of intellectual property\\ninfringement made by third parties arising from the use of our products and certain other matters. Additionally, we have agreed to cover damages resulting from breaches of certain security and privacy commitments in our cloud business. In evaluating\\nestimated losses on these indemnifications, we consider factors such as the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and our ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss. These obligations did not have a material impact on our\\nconsolidated financial statements during the periods presented. \\n\\n \\u00a0\\n 44 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\u00a0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n PART II \\n Item 7 \\n \\u00a0\\n\\n Contractual Obligations \\n The following table summarizes the payments due by fiscal year for our outstanding contractual obligations as of June\\u00a030, 2016: \\n \\u00a0\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t(In millions)\\t\\u00a0\\u00a0\\t2017\\t\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\t2018-2019\\t\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\t2020-2021\\t\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\tThereafter\\t\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\tTotal\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t Long-term\\ndebt:\\u00a0(a)\\n\\t\\u00a0\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t Principal payments\\n\\t\\u00a0\\u00a0\\t$\\t0\\t\\u00a0\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\t$\\t5,050\\t\\u00a0\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\t$\\t5,250\\t\\u00a0\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\t$\\t30,649\\t\\u00a0\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\t$\\t40,949\\t\\u00a0\\u00a0\\n\\t Interest payments\\n\\t\\u00a0\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\t1,289\\t\\u00a0\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\t2,547\\t\\u00a0\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\t2,324\\t\\u00a0\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\t16,836\\t\\u00a0\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\t22,996\\t\\u00a0\\u00a0\\n\\t Construction commitments\\u00a0(b)\\n\\t\\u00a0\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\t1,809\\t\\u00a0\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\t162\\t\\u00a0\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\t0\\t\\u00a0\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\t0\\t\\u00a0\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\t1,971\\t\\u00a0\\u00a0\\n\\t Operating\\nleases\\u00a0(c)\\n\\t\\u00a0\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\t961\\t\\u00a0\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\t1,918\\t\\u00a0\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\t1,467\\t\\u00a0\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\t2,118\\t\\u00a0\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\t6,464\\t\\u00a0\\u00a0\\n\\t Purchase commitments\\u00a0(d)\\n\\t\\u00a0\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\t13,214\\t\\u00a0\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\t1,102\\t\\u00a0\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\t758\\t\\u00a0\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\t4,004\\t\\u00a0\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\t19,078\\t\\u00a0\\u00a0\\n\\t Other long-term liabilities\\u00a0(e)\\n\\t\\u00a0\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\t0\\t\\u00a0\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\t87\\t\\u00a0\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\t23\\t\\u00a0\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\t275\\t\\u00a0\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\t385\\t\\u00a0\\u00a0\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\u00a0\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\u00a0\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\u00a0\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\u00a0\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\n\\t Total contractual obligations\\n\\t\\u00a0\\u00a0\\t$\\t\\u00a0\\u00a017,273\\t\\u00a0\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\t$\\t\\u00a0\\u00a010,866\\t\\u00a0\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\t$\\t\\u00a0\\u00a09,822\\t\\u00a0\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\t$\\t\\u00a0\\u00a053,882\\t\\u00a0\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\t$\\t\\u00a0\\u00a091,843\\t\\u00a0\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\u00a0\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\u00a0\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\u00a0\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\u00a0\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\u00a0\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\n\\n \\u00a0\\n\\n\\t(a)\\t See Note 12 \\u2013 Debt of the Notes to Financial Statements (Part II, Item\\u00a08 of this Form 10-K). \\n\\n\\n\\n\\t(b)\\t These amounts represent commitments for the construction of buildings, building improvements, and leasehold improvements. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\t(c)\\t These amounts represent undiscounted future minimum rental commitments under noncancellable facilities leases. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\t(d)\\t These amounts represent purchase commitments, including all open purchase orders and all contracts that are take-or-pay contracts that are not presented as\\nconstruction commitments above. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\t(e)\\t We have excluded long-term tax contingencies, other tax liabilities, deferred income taxes, and long-term pension liabilities of $13.0 billion from the\\namounts presented as the timing of these obligations is uncertain. We have also excluded unearned revenue and non-cash items. \\n\\n\\n\\nOther Planned Uses of Capital \\n In June\\n2016, we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire LinkedIn in an all-cash transaction valued at $26.2 billion, inclusive of LinkedIn\\u2019s net cash. We expect the acquisition will close in calendar year 2016, and we will finance the\\ntransaction primarily through the issuance of new debt. \\n We will continue to invest in sales, marketing, product support infrastructure,\\nand existing and advanced areas of technology, as well as continue making acquisitions that align with our business strategy. Additions to property and equipment will continue, including new facilities, datacenters, and computer systems for research\\nand development, sales and marketing, support, and administrative staff. We expect capital expenditures to increase in coming years in support of our productivity and platform strategy. We have operating leases for most U.S. and international sales\\nand support offices and certain equipment. We have not engaged in any related party transactions or arrangements with unconsolidated entities or other persons that are reasonably likely to materially affect liquidity or the availability of capital\\nresources. \\n Liquidity \\n We earn a\\nsignificant amount of our operating income outside the U.S., which is deemed to be permanently reinvested in foreign jurisdictions. As a result, as discussed above under Cash, Cash Equivalents, and Investments, the majority of our cash, cash\\nequivalents, and short-term investments are held by foreign subsidiaries. We currently do not intend nor foresee a need to repatriate these funds. We expect existing domestic cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments, cash flows from\\noperations, and access to capital markets to continue to be sufficient to fund our domestic operating activities and cash commitments for investing and financing activities, such as regular quarterly dividends, debt maturities, and material capital\\nexpenditures, for at least the next 12 months and thereafter for the foreseeable future. In addition, we expect existing foreign cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments, and cash flows from operations to continue to be sufficient to fund our\\nforeign operating activities and cash commitments for investing activities, such as material capital expenditures, for at least the next 12 months and thereafter for the foreseeable future. \\n\\n \\u00a0\\n 45 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\u00a0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n PART II \\n Item 7 \\n \\u00a0\\n\\n Should we require more capital in the U.S. than is generated by our operations domestically, for\\nexample to fund significant discretionary activities, such as business acquisitions and share repurchases, we could elect to repatriate future earnings from foreign jurisdictions or raise capital in the U.S. through debt or equity issuances. These\\nalternatives could result in higher effective tax rates, increased interest expense, or dilution of our earnings. We have borrowed funds domestically and continue to believe we have the ability to do so at reasonable interest rates. \\n\\nRECENT ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE \\n\\nSee Note 1 \\u2013 Accounting Policies of the Notes to Financial Statements (Part II, Item\\u00a08 of this Form 10-K) for further discussion.\\n\\n APPLICATION OF CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES \\n Our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Preparing consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect\\nthe reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses. These estimates and assumptions are affected by management\\u2019s application of accounting policies. Critical accounting policies for us include revenue recognition, impairment of\\ninvestment securities, goodwill, research and development costs, contingencies, income taxes, and inventories. \\n Revenue Recognition \\n\\nRevenue recognition for multiple-element arrangements requires judgment to determine if multiple elements exist, whether elements can be accounted\\nfor as separate units of accounting, and if so, the fair value for each of the elements. \\n Judgment is also required to assess whether\\nfuture releases of certain software represent new products or upgrades and enhancements to existing products. Certain volume licensing arrangements include a perpetual license for current products combined with rights to receive unspecified future\\nversions of software products and are accounted for as subscriptions, with billings recorded as unearned revenue and recognized as revenue ratably over the coverage period. \\n Software updates are evaluated on a case-by-case basis to determine whether they meet the definition of an upgrade, which may require revenue to be deferred and recognized when the upgrade is delivered. If it is\\ndetermined that implied post-contract customer support (\\u201cPCS\\u201d) is being provided, revenue from the arrangement is deferred and recognized over the implied PCS term. If updates are determined to not meet the definition of an upgrade,\\nrevenue is generally recognized as products are shipped or made available. \\n Microsoft enters into arrangements that can include various\\ncombinations of software, services, and hardware. Where elements are delivered over different periods of time, and when allowed under U.S. GAAP, revenue is allocated to the respective elements based on their relative selling prices at the inception\\nof the arrangement, and revenue is recognized as each element is delivered. We use a hierarchy to determine the fair value to be used for allocating revenue to elements: (i) vendor-specific objective evidence of fair value (\\u201cVSOE\\u201d), (ii)\\nthird-party evidence, and (iii) best estimate of selling price (\\u201cESP\\u201d). For software elements, we follow the industry-specific software guidance which only allows for the use of VSOE in establishing fair value. Generally, VSOE is the price\\ncharged when the deliverable is sold separately or the price established by management for a product that is not yet sold if it is probable that the price will not change before introduction into the marketplace. ESPs are established as best\\nestimates of what the selling prices would be if the deliverables were sold regularly on a stand-alone basis. Our process for determining ESPs requires judgment and considers multiple factors that may vary over time depending upon the unique facts\\nand circumstances related to each deliverable. \\n In January 2015, we announced Windows 10 would be free to all qualified existing users\\nof Windows 7 and Windows 8.1. This offer differs from historical offers preceding the launch of new versions of Windows as it is being made \\n\\n \\u00a0\\n 46 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\u00a0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n PART II \\n Item 7 \\n \\u00a0\\n\\n \\navailable for free to existing users in addition to new customers after the offer announcement. We evaluated the nature and accounting treatment of the Windows 10 offer and determined that it\\nrepresents a marketing and promotional activity, in part because the offer is being made available for free to existing users. As this is a marketing and promotional activity, revenue recognition of new sales of Windows 8 will continue to be\\nrecognized as delivered. \\n Customers purchasing a Windows 10 license will receive unspecified updates and upgrades over the life of their\\nWindows 10 device at no additional cost. As these updates and upgrades will not be sold on a stand-alone basis, we are unable to establish VSOE. Accordingly, revenue from licenses of Windows 10 is recognized ratably over the estimated life of the\\nrelated device, which ranges between two to four years. \\n We currently are evaluating the impact of the new standard related to revenue\\nrecognition, which we anticipate will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. See Note 1 \\u2013 Accounting Policies of the Notes to Financial Statements (Part II, Item\\u00a08 of this Form 10-K) for further discussion.\\n\\n Impairment of Investment Securities \\n We review investments quarterly for indicators of other-than-temporary impairment. This determination requires significant judgment. In making this judgment, we employ a systematic methodology quarterly that\\nconsiders available quantitative and qualitative evidence in evaluating potential impairment of our investments. If the cost of an investment exceeds its fair value, we evaluate, among other factors, general market conditions, credit quality of debt\\ninstrument issuers, the duration and extent to which the fair value is less than cost, and for equity securities, our intent and ability to hold, or plans to sell, the investment. For fixed-income securities, we also evaluate whether we have plans\\nto sell the security or it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery. We also consider specific adverse conditions related to the financial health of and business outlook for the investee, including\\nindustry and sector performance, changes in technology, and operational and financing cash flow factors. Once a decline in fair value is determined to be other-than-temporary, an impairment charge is recorded to other income (expense), net and a new\\ncost basis in the investment is established. If market, industry, and/or investee conditions deteriorate, we may incur future impairments. \\n Goodwill\\n\\n We allocate goodwill to reporting units based on the reporting unit expected to benefit from the business combination. We evaluate\\nour reporting units on an annual basis and, if necessary, reassign goodwill using a relative fair value allocation approach. Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level (operating segment or one level below an operating segment) on\\nan annual basis (May 1 for us) and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value. These events or circumstances could include a\\nsignificant change in the business climate, legal factors, operating performance indicators, competition, or sale or disposition of a significant portion of a reporting unit. \\n Application of the goodwill impairment test requires judgment, including the identification of reporting units, assignment of assets and liabilities to reporting units, assignment of goodwill to reporting units,\\nand determination of the fair value of each reporting unit. The fair value of each reporting unit is estimated primarily through the use of a discounted cash flow methodology. This analysis requires significant judgments, including estimation of\\nfuture cash flows, which is dependent on internal forecasts, estimation of the long-term rate of growth for our business, estimation of the useful life over which cash flows will occur, and determination of our weighted average cost of capital.\\n\\n The estimates used to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit change from year to year based on operating results, market\\nconditions, and other factors. Changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value and goodwill impairment for each reporting unit. \\n\\n \\u00a0\\n 47 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\u00a0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n PART II \\n Item 7 \\n \\u00a0\\n\\n Research and Development Costs \\n Costs incurred internally in researching and developing a computer software product are charged to expense until technological feasibility has been established for the product. Once technological feasibility is\\nestablished, all software costs are capitalized until the product is available for general release to customers. Judgment is required in determining when technological feasibility of a product is established. We have determined that technological\\nfeasibility for our software products is reached after all high-risk development issues have been resolved through coding and testing. Generally, this occurs shortly before the products are released to manufacturing. The amortization of these costs\\nis included in cost of revenue over the estimated life of the products. \\n Legal and Other Contingencies \\n\\nThe outcomes of legal proceedings and claims brought against us are subject to significant uncertainty. An estimated loss from a loss contingency\\nsuch as a legal proceeding or claim is accrued by a charge to income if it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. In determining whether a loss should be\\naccrued we evaluate, among other factors, the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and the ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss. Changes in these factors could materially impact our consolidated financial\\nstatements. \\n Income Taxes \\n The\\nobjectives of accounting for income taxes are to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in an entity\\u2019s\\nfinancial statements or tax returns. We recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of\\nthe position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. Accounting literature also\\nprovides guidance on derecognition of income tax assets and liabilities, classification of deferred income tax assets and liabilities, accounting for interest and penalties associated with tax positions, and income tax disclosures. Judgment is\\nrequired in assessing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized on our consolidated financial statements or tax returns. Variations in the actual outcome of these future tax consequences could materially impact our consolidated\\nfinancial statements. \\n Inventories \\n Inventories are stated at average cost, subject to the lower of cost or market. Cost includes materials, labor, and manufacturing overhead related to the purchase and production of inventories. We regularly review\\ninventory quantities on hand, future purchase commitments with our suppliers, and the estimated utility of our inventory. These reviews include analysis of demand forecasts, product life cycle status, product development plans, current sales levels,\\npricing strategy, and component cost trends. If our review indicates a reduction in utility below carrying value, we reduce our inventory to a new cost basis through a charge to cost of revenue. \\n\\n \\u00a0\\n 48 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\u00a0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n PART II \\n Item 7 \\n \\u00a0\\n\\n STATEMENT OF MANAGEMENT\\u2019S RESPONSIBILITY FOR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS \\n\\nManagement is responsible for the preparation of the consolidated financial statements and related information that are presented in this report.\\nThe consolidated financial statements, which include amounts based on management\\u2019s estimates and judgments, have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. \\n\\nThe Company designs and maintains accounting and internal control systems to provide reasonable assurance at reasonable cost that assets are\\nsafeguarded against loss from unauthorized use or disposition, and that the financial records are reliable for preparing consolidated financial statements and maintaining accountability for assets. These systems are augmented by written policies, an\\norganizational structure providing division of responsibilities, careful selection and training of qualified personnel, and a program of internal audits. \\n The Company engaged Deloitte\\u00a0& Touche LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, to audit and render an opinion on the consolidated financial statements and internal control over financial\\nreporting in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). \\n The Board of Directors,\\nthrough its Audit Committee, consisting solely of independent directors of the Company, meets periodically with management, internal auditors, and our independent registered public accounting firm to ensure that each is meeting its responsibilities\\nand to discuss matters concerning internal controls and financial reporting. Deloitte\\u00a0& Touche LLP and the internal auditors each have full and free access to the Audit Committee. \\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\t\\n\\t Satya Nadella\\n\\n\\t Chief Executive Officer\\n\\n\\t\\n\\t Amy E.

A portion of these risks is hedged, but they may impact our consolidated financial\\nstatements. \\n Foreign Currency \\n\\nCertain forecasted transactions, assets, and liabilities are exposed to foreign currency risk. We monitor our foreign currency exposures daily and\\nuse hedges where practicable to offset the risks and maximize the economic effectiveness of our foreign currency positions. Principal currencies hedged include the euro, Japanese yen, British pound, Canadian dollar, and Australian dollar.\\n\\n Interest Rate \\n Our fixed-income\\nportfolio is diversified across credit sectors and maturities, consisting primarily of investment-grade securities. The credit risk and average maturity of the fixed-income portfolio is managed to achieve economic returns that correlate to certain\\nglobal and domestic fixed-income indices. In addition, we use \\u201cTo Be Announced\\u201d forward purchase commitments of mortgage-backed assets to gain exposure to agency mortgage-backed securities. \\n\\nEquity \\n Our equity portfolio consists of\\nglobal, developed, and emerging market securities that are subject to market price risk.\\u00a0We manage the securities relative to certain global and domestic indices and expect their economic risk and return to correlate with these indices.\\n\\n Commodity \\n We use broad-based\\ncommodity exposures to enhance portfolio returns and facilitate portfolio diversification. Our investment portfolio has exposure to a variety of commodities, including precious metals, energy, and grain. We manage these exposures relative to global\\ncommodity indices and expect their economic risk and return to correlate with these indices. \\n VALUE-AT-RISK \\n\\nWe use a value-at-risk (\\u201cVaR\\u201d) model to estimate and quantify our market risks. VaR is the expected loss, for a given confidence level,\\nin the fair value of our portfolio due to adverse market movements over a defined time horizon. The VaR model is not intended to represent actual losses in fair value, including determinations of other-than-temporary losses in fair value in\\naccordance with U.S. GAAP, but is used as a risk estimation and management tool. The distribution of the potential changes in total market value of all holdings is computed based on the historical volatilities and correlations among foreign exchange\\nrates, interest rates, equity prices, and commodity prices, assuming normal market conditions. \\n The VaR is calculated as the total loss\\nthat will not be exceeded at the 97.5 percentile confidence level or, alternatively stated, the losses could exceed the VaR in 25 out of 1,000 cases. Several risk factors are not captured in the model, including liquidity risk, operational risk, and\\nlegal risk. \\n\\n \\u00a0\\n 50 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\u00a0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n PART II \\n Item 7A \\n \\u00a0\\n\\n The following table sets forth the one-day VaR for substantially all of our positions as of\\nJune\\u00a030, 2016 and 2015 and for the year ended June\\u00a030, 2016: \\n \\u00a0\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t(In millions)\\t\\u00a0\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\u00a0\\t June\\u00a030,\\n 2016\\n\\t\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\t June\\u00a030,\\n 2015\\n\\t\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\t Year\\u00a0Ended June\\u00a030,\\n\\n2016\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\n\\tRisk Categories\\t\\u00a0\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\tAverage\\t\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\tHigh\\t\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\tLow\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t Foreign currency\\n\\t\\u00a0\\u00a0\\t$\\t92\\t\\u00a0\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\t$\\t\\u00a0\\u00a0120\\t\\u00a0\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\t$\\t\\u00a0\\u00a0171\\t\\u00a0\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\t$\\t\\u00a0\\u00a0258\\t\\u00a0\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\t$\\t83\\t\\u00a0\\u00a0\\n\\t Interest rate\\n\\t\\u00a0\\u00a0\\t$\\t58\\t\\u00a0\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\t$\\t51\\t\\u00a0\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\t$\\t56\\t\\u00a0\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\t$\\t63\\t\\u00a0\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\t$\\t50\\t\\u00a0\\u00a0\\n\\t Equity\\n\\t\\u00a0\\u00a0\\t$\\t\\u00a0\\u00a0157\\t\\u00a0\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\t$\\t149\\t\\u00a0\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\t$\\t163\\t\\u00a0\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\t$\\t178\\t\\u00a0\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\t$\\t\\u00a0\\u00a0137\\t\\u00a0\\u00a0\\n\\t Commodity\\n\\t\\u00a0\\u00a0\\t$\\t12\\t\\u00a0\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\t$\\t13\\t\\u00a0\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\t$\\t10\\t\\u00a0\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\t$\\t14\\t\\u00a0\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\t$\\t6\\t\\u00a0\\u00a0\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\n\\n Total one-day VaR for the combined risk categories was $225 million as of June\\u00a030, 2016 and $237 million as of\\nJune\\u00a030, 2015.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS \\n\\nNOTE 1 \\u2014 ACCOUNTING POLICIES \\n\\nAccounting Principles \\n The consolidated\\nfinancial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (\\u201cU.S. GAAP\\u201d). \\n We have recast certain prior period amounts to conform to the current period presentation, with no impact on consolidated net income or cash flows. \\n Principles of Consolidation \\n The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of\\nMicrosoft Corporation and its subsidiaries. Intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated. Equity investments through which we are able to exercise significant influence over but do not control the investee and are not the primary\\nbeneficiary of the investee\\u2019s activities are accounted for using the equity method. Investments through which we are not able to exercise significant influence over the investee and which do not have readily determinable fair values are\\naccounted for under the cost method. \\n Segment Information \\n In June 2015, we announced a change in organizational structure to align to our strategic direction as a productivity and platform company. During the first quarter of fiscal year 2016, our chief operating decision\\nmaker, who is also our Chief Executive Officer, requested changes in the information that he regularly reviews for purposes of allocating resources and assessing performance. As a result, beginning in fiscal year 2016, we report our financial\\nperformance based on our new segments described in Note 21 \\u2013 Segment Information and Geographic Data. We have recast certain prior period amounts to conform to the way we internally manage and monitor segment performance during fiscal year\\n2016. This change primarily impacted Note 10 \\u2013 Goodwill, Note 15 \\u2013 Unearned Revenue, and Note 21 \\u2013 Segment Information and Geographic Data, with no impact on consolidated net income or cash flows. \\n\\nEstimates and Assumptions \\n Preparing\\nfinancial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses. Examples of estimates include: loss contingencies; product warranties; the fair value of,\\nand/or potential impairment of goodwill and intangible assets, for our reporting units; product life cycles; useful lives of our tangible and intangible assets; allowances for doubtful accounts; allowances for product returns; the market value of\\nand volume of demand for our inventory; and stock-based compensation forfeiture rates. Examples of assumptions include: the elements comprising a software arrangement, including the distinction between upgrades or enhancements and new products; when\\ntechnological feasibility is achieved for our products; the potential outcome of future tax consequences of events that have been recognized on our consolidated financial statements or tax returns; and determining when investment impairments are\\nother-than-temporary. Actual results and outcomes may differ from management\\u2019s estimates and assumptions. \\n Foreign Currencies \\n\\nAssets and liabilities recorded in foreign currencies are translated at the exchange rate on the balance sheet date. Revenue and expenses are\\ntranslated at average rates of exchange prevailing during the year. Translation adjustments resulting from this process are recorded to other comprehensive income (\\u201cOCI\\u201d). \\n\\n \\u00a0\\n 57 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\u00a0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n PART II \\n Item 8 \\n \\u00a0\\n\\n Product Revenue and Service and Other Revenue \\n\\nService revenue exceeded 10% of total revenue for the first time in fiscal year 2016. As a result, we have separately disclosed product revenue and\\nservice and other revenue on our consolidated income statements. \\n Product revenue includes sales from operating systems; cross-device\\nproductivity applications; server applications; business solution applications; desktop and server management tools; software development tools; video games; hardware such as PCs, tablets, gaming and entertainment consoles, phones, other intelligent\\ndevices, and related accessories; and training and certification of computer system integrators and developers. \\n Service and other\\nrevenue includes sales from cloud-based solutions that provide customers with software, services, platforms, and content such as Office 365, Microsoft Azure (\\u201cAzure\\u201d), Microsoft Dynamics (\\u201cDynamics\\u201d) CRM Online, and Xbox Live;\\nsolution support; and consulting services. Service and other revenue also includes sales from online advertising. \\n Revenue Recognition\\n\\n Revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the fee is fixed or determinable,\\nand collectability is probable. Revenue generally is recognized net of allowances for returns and any taxes collected from customers and subsequently remitted to governmental authorities. \\n\\nRevenue recognition for multiple-element arrangements requires judgment to determine if multiple elements exist, whether elements can be accounted\\nfor as separate units of accounting, and if so, the fair value for each of the elements. \\n Microsoft enters into arrangements that can\\ninclude various combinations of software, services, and hardware. Where elements are delivered over different periods of time, and when allowed under U.S. GAAP, revenue is allocated to the respective elements based on their relative selling prices\\nat the inception of the arrangement, and revenue is recognized as each element is delivered. We use a hierarchy to determine the fair value to be used for allocating revenue to elements: (i)\\u00a0vendor-specific objective evidence of fair value\\n(\\u201cVSOE\\u201d), (ii)\\u00a0third-party evidence, and (iii)\\u00a0best estimate of selling price (\\u201cESP\\u201d). For software elements, we follow the industry specific software guidance which only allows for the use of VSOE in establishing fair\\nvalue. Generally, VSOE is the price charged when the deliverable is sold separately or the price established by management for a product that is not yet sold if it is probable that the price will not change before introduction into the marketplace.\\nESPs are established as best estimates of what the selling prices would be if the deliverables were sold regularly on a stand-alone basis. Our process for determining ESPs requires judgment and considers multiple factors that may vary over time\\ndepending upon the unique facts and circumstances related to each deliverable. \\n Revenue for retail packaged products, products licensed\\nto original equipment manufacturers (\\u201cOEMs\\u201d), and perpetual licenses under certain volume licensing programs generally is recognized as products are shipped or made available. \\n\\nTechnology guarantee programs are accounted for as multiple-element arrangements as customers receive free or significantly discounted rights to\\nuse upcoming new versions of a software product if they license existing versions of the product during the eligibility period. Revenue is allocated between the existing product and the new product, and revenue allocated to the new product is\\ndeferred until that version is delivered. The revenue allocation is based on the VSOE of fair value of the products. The VSOE of fair value for upcoming new products are based on the price determined by management having the relevant authority when\\nthe element is not yet sold separately, but is expected to be sold in the near future at the price set by management. \\n Software updates\\nthat will be provided free of charge are evaluated on a case-by-case basis to determine whether they meet the definition of an upgrade and create a multiple-element arrangement, which may require revenue to be deferred and recognized when the\\nupgrade is delivered, or if it is determined that implied post-contract customer support (\\u201cPCS\\u201d) is being provided, the arrangement is accounted for as a multiple-element arrangement and all\\n\\n\\n \\u00a0\\n 58 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\u00a0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n PART II \\n Item 8 \\n \\u00a0\\n\\n \\nrevenue from the arrangement is deferred and recognized over the implied PCS term when the VSOE of fair value does not exist. If updates are determined to not meet the definition of an upgrade,\\nrevenue is generally recognized as products are shipped or made available. \\n Customers purchasing a Windows 10 license will receive\\nunspecified updates and upgrades over the life of their Windows 10 device at no additional cost. As these updates and upgrades will not be sold on a stand-alone basis, we are unable to establish VSOE of fair value. Accordingly, revenue from licenses\\nof Windows 10 is recognized ratably over the estimated life of the related device, which ranges between two to four years. \\n Certain\\nvolume licensing arrangements include a perpetual license for current products combined with rights to receive unspecified future versions of software products, which we have determined are additional software products and are therefore accounted\\nfor as subscriptions, with billings recorded as unearned revenue and recognized as revenue ratably over the coverage period. Arrangements that include term-based licenses for current products with the right to use unspecified future versions of the\\nsoftware during the coverage period, are also accounted for as subscriptions, with revenue recognized ratably over the coverage period. Revenue from cloud-based services arrangements that allow for the use of a hosted software product or service\\nover a contractually determined period of time without taking possession of software are accounted for as subscriptions with billings recorded as unearned revenue and recognized as revenue ratably over the coverage period beginning on the date the\\nservice is made available to customers. Revenue from cloud-based services arrangements that are provided on a consumption basis (for example, the amount of storage used in a particular period) is recognized commensurate with the customer utilization\\nof such resources. \\n Some volume licensing arrangements include time-based subscriptions for cloud-based services and software offerings\\nthat are accounted for as subscriptions. These arrangements are considered multiple-element arrangements. However, because all elements are accounted for as subscriptions and have the same coverage period and delivery pattern, they have the same\\nrevenue recognition timing. \\n Revenue related to Microsoft Surface (\\u201cSurface\\u201d) devices, Xbox consoles, games published by us,\\nphones, and other hardware components is generally recognized when ownership is transferred to the resellers or to end customers when selling directly through Microsoft retail stores and online marketplaces. A portion of revenue may be deferred when\\nthese products are combined with software elements, and/or services. Revenue related to licensing for games published by third parties for use on the Xbox consoles is recognized when games are manufactured by the game publishers. \\n\\nDisplay advertising revenue is recognized as advertisements are displayed. Search advertising revenue is recognized when the ad appears in the\\nsearch results or when the action necessary to earn the revenue has been completed. Consulting services revenue is recognized as services are rendered, generally based on the negotiated hourly rate in the consulting arrangement and the number of\\nhours worked during the period. Consulting revenue for fixed-price services arrangements is recognized as services are provided. \\n Cost of Revenue\\n\\n Cost of revenue includes: manufacturing and distribution costs for products sold and programs licensed; operating costs related to\\nproduct support service centers and product distribution centers; costs incurred to include software on PCs sold by OEMs, to drive traffic to our websites, and to acquire online advertising space; costs incurred to support and maintain\\nInternet-based products and services, including datacenter costs and royalties; warranty costs; inventory valuation adjustments; costs associated with the delivery of consulting services; and the amortization of capitalized software development\\ncosts. Capitalized software development costs are amortized over the estimated lives of the products. \\n Product Warranty \\n\\nWe provide for the estimated costs of fulfilling our obligations under hardware and software warranties at the time the related revenue is\\nrecognized. For hardware warranties, we estimate the costs based on historical and projected \\n\\n \\u00a0\\n 59 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\u00a0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n PART II \\n Item 8 \\n \\u00a0\\n\\n \\nproduct failure rates, historical and projected repair costs, and knowledge of specific product failures (if any). The specific hardware warranty terms and conditions vary depending upon the\\nproduct sold and the country in which we do business, but generally include parts and labor over a period generally ranging from 90\\u00a0days to three years. For software warranties, we estimate the costs to provide bug fixes, such as security\\npatches, over the estimated life of the software. We regularly reevaluate our estimates to assess the adequacy of the recorded warranty liabilities and adjust the amounts as necessary. \\n Research and Development \\n Research and development expenses include payroll, employee\\nbenefits, stock-based compensation expense, and other headcount-related expenses associated with product development. Research and development expenses also include third-party development and programming costs, localization costs incurred to\\ntranslate software for international markets, and the amortization of purchased software code and services content. Such costs related to software development are included in research and development expense until the point that technological\\nfeasibility is reached, which for our software products, is generally shortly before the products are released to manufacturing. Once technological feasibility is reached, such costs are capitalized and amortized to cost of revenue over the\\nestimated lives of the products. \\n Sales and Marketing \\n Sales and marketing expenses include payroll, employee benefits, stock-based compensation expense, and other headcount-related expenses associated with sales and marketing personnel, and the costs of advertising,\\npromotions, trade shows, seminars, and other programs. Advertising costs are expensed as incurred. Advertising expense was $1.6 billion, $1.9 billion, and $2.3 billion in fiscal years 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively. \\n\\nStock-Based Compensation \\n Compensation cost\\nfor stock awards is measured at the fair value on the grant date and recognized as expense, net of estimated forfeitures, over the related service period using the straight-line method. The fair value of stock awards is based on the quoted price of\\nour common stock on the grant date less the present value of expected dividends not received during the vesting period. Compensation expense for the employee stock purchase plan (\\u201cESPP\\u201d) is measured as the discount the employee is entitled\\nto upon purchase and is recognized in the period of purchase. \\n Income Taxes \\n\\nIncome tax expense includes U.S. and international income taxes, the provision for U.S. taxes on undistributed earnings of international\\nsubsidiaries not deemed to be permanently reinvested, and interest and penalties on uncertain tax positions. Certain income and expenses are not reported in tax returns and financial statements in the same year. The tax effect of such temporary\\ndifferences is reported as deferred income taxes. Deferred tax assets are reported net of a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized. All deferred income taxes are classified as long-term on our\\nconsolidated balance sheets. \\n Fair Value Measurements \\n We account for certain assets and liabilities at fair value. The hierarchy below lists three levels of fair value based on the extent to which inputs used in measuring fair value are observable in the\\nmarket.\\u00a0We categorize each of our fair value measurements in one of these three levels based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. These levels are: \\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\t\\u00a0\\t\\u2022\\t\\u00a0\\t Level 1 \\u2013 inputs are based upon unadjusted quoted prices for identical instruments traded in active markets. Our Level 1 non-derivative\\ninvestments primarily include U.S. government securities, domestic and international equities, and actively traded mutual funds.\\u00a0Our Level 1 derivative assets and liabilities include those actively traded on exchanges.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\u00a0\\n 60 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\u00a0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n PART II \\n Item 8 \\n \\u00a0\\n\\n\\n\\t\\u00a0\\t\\u2022\\t\\u00a0\\t Level 2 \\u2013 inputs are based upon quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in\\nmarkets that are not active, and model-based valuation techniques (e.g. the Black-Scholes model) for which all significant inputs are observable in the market or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the\\nassets or liabilities. Where applicable, these models project future cash flows and discount the future amounts to a present value using market-based observable inputs including interest rate curves, credit spreads, foreign exchange rates, and\\nforward and spot prices for currencies and commodities. Our Level 2 non-derivative investments consist primarily of corporate notes and bonds, common and preferred stock, mortgage- and asset-backed securities, U.S. government and agency securities,\\nand foreign government bonds. Our Level 2 derivative assets and liabilities primarily include certain over-the-counter option and swap contracts. \\n\\n\\n \\u00a0\\n\\n\\t\\u00a0\\t\\u2022\\t\\u00a0\\t Level 3 \\u2013 inputs are generally unobservable and typically reflect management\\u2019s estimates of assumptions that market participants would use in\\npricing the asset or liability. The fair values are therefore determined using model-based techniques, including option pricing models and discounted cash flow models. Our Level 3 non-derivative assets primarily comprise investments in common and\\npreferred stock, and goodwill and intangible assets, when they are recorded at fair value due to an impairment charge.\\u00a0Unobservable inputs used in the models are significant to the fair values of the assets and liabilities.\\n\\n\\n\\n We measure certain assets, including our cost and equity method investments, at fair value on a nonrecurring basis\\nwhen they are deemed to be other-than-temporarily impaired. The fair values of these investments are determined based on valuation techniques using the best information available, and may include quoted market prices, market comparables, and\\ndiscounted cash flow projections. An impairment charge is recorded when the cost of the investment exceeds its fair value and this condition is determined to be other-than-temporary. \\n\\nOur other current financial assets and our current financial liabilities have fair values that approximate their carrying values. \\n\\nFinancial Instruments \\n Investments \\n\\nWe consider all highly liquid interest-earning investments with a maturity of three months or less at the date of purchase to be cash equivalents.\\nThe fair values of these investments approximate their carrying values. In general, investments with original maturities of greater than three months and remaining maturities of less than one year are classified as short-term investments.\\nInvestments with maturities beyond one year may be classified as short-term based on their highly liquid nature and because such marketable securities represent the investment of cash that is available for current operations. All cash equivalents\\nand short-term investments are classified as available-for-sale and realized gains and losses are recorded using the specific identification method. Changes in market value, excluding other-than-temporary impairments, are reflected in OCI.\\n\\n Equity and other investments classified as long-term include both debt and equity instruments. Debt and publicly-traded equity\\nsecurities are classified as available-for-sale and realized gains and losses are recorded using the specific identification method. Changes in the market value of available-for-sale securities, excluding other-than-temporary impairments, are\\nreflected in OCI. Common and preferred stock and other investments that are restricted for more than one year or are not publicly traded are recorded at cost or using the equity method. \\n\\nWe lend certain fixed-income and equity securities to increase investment returns. These transactions are accounted for as secured borrowings and\\nthe loaned securities continue to be carried as investments on our consolidated balance sheets. Cash and/or security interests are received as collateral for the loaned securities with the amount determined based upon the underlying security lent\\nand the creditworthiness of the borrower. Cash received is recorded as an asset with a corresponding liability. \\n Investments are\\nconsidered to be impaired when a decline in fair value is judged to be other-than-temporary. Fair value is calculated based on publicly available market information or other estimates determined by management. We employ a systematic methodology on a\\nquarterly basis that considers available quantitative and qualitative \\n\\n \\u00a0\\n 61 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\u00a0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n PART II \\n Item 8 \\n \\u00a0\\n\\n \\nevidence in evaluating potential impairment of our investments. If the cost of an investment exceeds its fair value, we evaluate, among other factors, general market conditions, credit quality of\\ndebt instrument issuers, the duration and extent to which the fair value is less than cost, and for equity securities, our intent and ability to hold, or plans to sell, the investment. For fixed-income securities, we also evaluate whether we have\\nplans to sell the security or it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery. We also consider specific adverse conditions related to the financial health of and business outlook for the investee, including\\nindustry and sector performance, changes in technology, and operational and financing cash flow factors. Once a decline in fair value is determined to be other-than-temporary, an impairment charge is recorded to other income (expense), net and a new\\ncost basis in the investment is established. \\n Derivatives \\n Derivative instruments are recognized as either assets or liabilities and are measured at fair value. The accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and\\nthe resulting designation. \\n For derivative instruments designated as fair value hedges, the gains (losses) are recognized in earnings in\\nthe periods of change together with the offsetting losses (gains) on the hedged items attributed to the risk being hedged. For options designated as fair value hedges, changes in the time value are excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness\\nand are recognized in earnings. \\n For derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges, the effective portion of the gains (losses)\\non the derivatives is initially reported as a component of OCI and is subsequently recognized in earnings when the hedged exposure is recognized in earnings. For options designated as cash flow hedges, changes in the time value are excluded from the\\nassessment of hedge effectiveness and are recognized in earnings. Gains (losses) on derivatives representing either hedge components excluded from the assessment of effectiveness or hedge ineffectiveness are recognized in earnings. \\n\\nFor derivative instruments that are not designated as hedges, gains (losses) from changes in fair values are primarily recognized in other income\\n(expense), net. Other than those derivatives entered into for investment purposes, such as commodity contracts, the gains (losses) are generally economically offset by unrealized gains (losses) in the underlying available-for-sale securities, which\\nare recorded as a component of OCI until the securities are sold or other-than-temporarily impaired, at which time the amounts are reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income (\\u201cAOCI\\u201d) into other income (expense), net.\\n\\n Allowance for Doubtful Accounts \\n\\nThe allowance for doubtful accounts reflects our best estimate of probable losses inherent in the accounts receivable balance. We determine the\\nallowance based on known troubled accounts, historical experience, and other currently available evidence. Activity in the allowance for doubtful accounts was as follows: \\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t(In millions)\\t\\u00a0\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\tYear Ended June\\u00a030,\\t\\u00a0\\u00a0\\t2016\\t\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\t2015\\t\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\t2014\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t Balance, beginning of period\\n\\t\\u00a0\\u00a0\\t$\\t\\u00a0\\u00a0335\\t\\u00a0\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\t$\\t\\u00a0\\u00a0301\\t\\u00a0\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\t$\\t\\u00a0\\u00a0336\\t\\u00a0\\u00a0\\n\\t Charged to costs and other\\n\\t\\u00a0\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\t146\\t\\u00a0\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\t77\\t\\u00a0\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\t16\\t\\u00a0\\u00a0\\n\\t Write-offs\\n\\t\\u00a0\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\t(55\\t)\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\t(43\\t)\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\t(51\\t)\\u00a0\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\u00a0\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\u00a0\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\n\\t Balance, end of period\\n\\t\\u00a0\\u00a0\\t$\\t426\\t\\u00a0\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\t$\\t335\\t\\u00a0\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\t$\\t301\\t\\u00a0\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\u00a0\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\u00a0\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\u00a0\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\n\\n Inventories \\n\\nInventories are stated at average cost, subject to the lower of cost or market.

If our review indicates a reduction in utility below carrying value, we reduce our\\ninventory to a new cost basis through a charge to cost of revenue. \\n Property and Equipment \\n\\nProperty and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation, and depreciated using the straight-line method over the shorter of the\\nestimated useful life of the asset or the lease term. The estimated useful lives of our property and equipment are generally as follows: computer software developed or acquired for internal use, three to seven years; computer equipment, two to three\\nyears; buildings and improvements, five to 15 years; leasehold improvements, three to 20 years; and furniture and equipment, one to 10 years. Land is not depreciated. \\n Goodwill \\n Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level (operating segment or\\none level below an operating segment) on an annual basis (May 1 for us) and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value.\\n\\n Intangible Assets \\n All of our\\nintangible assets are subject to amortization and are amortized using the straight-line method over their estimated period of benefit, ranging from one to 15 years. We evaluate the recoverability of intangible assets periodically by taking into\\naccount events or circumstances that may warrant revised estimates of useful lives or that indicate the asset may be impaired. \\n Recent Accounting\\nGuidance \\n Recently adopted accounting guidance \\n Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting \\n In March 2016, the Financial\\nAccounting Standards Board (\\u201cFASB\\u201d) issued a new standard that changes the accounting for certain aspects of share-based payments to employees. The new guidance requires excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies to be recorded in the income\\nstatement when stock awards vest or are settled. In addition, cash flows related to excess tax benefits will no longer be separately classified as a financing activity apart from other income tax cash flows. The standard also allows us to repurchase\\nmore of an employee\\u2019s vesting shares for tax withholding purposes without triggering liability accounting, clarifies that all cash payments made to tax authorities on an employee\\u2019s behalf for withheld shares should be presented as a\\nfinancing activity on our cash flows statement, and provides an accounting policy election to account for forfeitures as they occur. The new standard is effective for us beginning July\\u00a01, 2017, with early adoption permitted. \\n\\nWe elected to early adopt the new guidance in the third quarter of fiscal year 2016 which requires us to reflect any adjustments as of July\\u00a01,\\n2015, the beginning of the annual period that includes the interim period of adoption. The primary impact of adoption was the recognition of excess tax benefits in our provision for income taxes rather than paid-in capital for all periods in fiscal\\nyear 2016.\\u00a0Additional amendments to the accounting for income taxes and minimum statutory withholding tax requirements had no impact to retained earnings as of July\\u00a01, 2015, where the cumulative effect of these changes are required to be\\nrecorded. We have elected to continue to estimate forfeitures expected to occur to determine the amount of compensation cost to be recognized in each period. \\n We elected to apply the presentation requirements for cash flows related to excess tax benefits retrospectively to all periods presented which resulted in an increase to both net cash from operations and net cash\\nused in financing of $588 million and $271 million for the years ended June\\u00a030, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The presentation requirements for cash flows related to employee taxes paid for withheld shares had no impact to any of the periods\\npresented on our consolidated cash flows statements since such cash flows have historically been presented as a financing activity. \\n\\n \\u00a0\\n 63 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\u00a0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n PART II \\n Item 8 \\n \\u00a0\\n\\n Adoption of the new standard resulted in the recognition of excess tax benefits in our provision\\nfor income taxes rather than paid-in capital of $402 million for the year ended June\\u00a030, 2016. \\n Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes\\n\\n In November 2015, the FASB issued guidance that requires companies to classify all deferred tax assets and liabilities as\\nnoncurrent on the balance sheet rather than separately disclosing deferred taxes as current and noncurrent. This standard is effective for us beginning July\\u00a01, 2017, and can be early adopted and applied either prospectively or retrospectively\\nto all periods presented upon adoption. \\n We elected to early adopt the new guidance in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2016 on a\\nretrospective basis. While the guidance changes the manner in which deferred taxes are classified on the balance sheet, we are still required to offset deferred tax assets and liabilities for each taxpaying component within a tax jurisdiction.\\nAdoption of the new standard impacted our previously reported results as follows: \\n \\u00a0\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t(In millions)\\t\\u00a0\\u00a0\\t June\\u00a030,\\n 2015\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\n\\u00a0\\tAs\\nadjusted\\t\\u00a0\\u00a0\\n\\u00a0\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\n\\u00a0\\tAs\\nreported\\t\\u00a0\\u00a0\\n\\u00a0\\u00a0\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t Balance sheets:\\n\\t\\u00a0\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t Current deferred income tax assets\\n\\t\\u00a0\\u00a0\\t$\\t0\\t\\u00a0\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\t$\\t1,915\\t\\u00a0\\u00a0\\n\\t Other long-term assets\\n\\t\\u00a0\\u00a0\\t$\\t3,117\\t\\u00a0\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\t$\\t2,953\\t\\u00a0\\u00a0\\n\\t Other current liabilities\\n\\t\\u00a0\\u00a0\\t$\\t6,555\\t\\u00a0\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\t$\\t6,766\\t\\u00a0\\u00a0\\n\\t Long-term deferred income tax liabilities\\n\\t\\u00a0\\u00a0\\t$\\t\\u00a0\\u00a01,295\\t\\u00a0\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\t$\\t\\u00a0\\u00a02,835\\t\\u00a0\\u00a0\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\n\\n Recent accounting guidance not yet adopted \\n Financial Instruments \\u2013 Credit Losses \\n In June 2016, the FASB issued a new standard to\\nreplace the incurred loss impairment methodology in current GAAP with a methodology that reflects expected credit losses and requires consideration of a broader range of reasonable and supportable information to inform credit loss estimates. For\\ntrade and other receivables, loans, and other financial instruments, we will be required to use a forward-looking expected loss model rather than the incurred loss model for recognizing credit losses which reflects losses that are probable. Credit\\nlosses relating to available-for-sale debt securities will also be recorded through an allowance for credit losses rather than as a reduction in the amortized cost basis of the securities. The new standard will be effective for us beginning\\nJuly\\u00a01, 2020, with early adoption permitted beginning July\\u00a01, 2019. Application of the amendments is through a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the effective date. We are currently evaluating the impact of this\\nstandard on our consolidated financial statements. \\n Leases \\n In February 2016, the FASB issued a new standard related to leases to increase transparency and comparability among organizations by requiring the recognition of lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance\\nsheet. Most prominent among the amendments is the recognition of assets and liabilities by lessees for those leases classified as operating leases under previous U.S. GAAP. Under the new standard, disclosures are required to meet the objective of\\nenabling users of financial statements to assess the amount, timing, and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases. We will be required to recognize and measure leases at the beginning of the earliest period presented using a modified\\nretrospective approach. \\n The new standard will be effective for us beginning July\\u00a01, 2019, with early adoption permitted. We\\ncurrently anticipate early adoption of the new standard effective July\\u00a01, 2017 in conjunction with our adoption of the new revenue standard.\\u00a0Our ability to early adopt is dependent on system readiness, including software procured from\\nthird-party providers, and the completion of our analysis of information necessary to restate prior period financial statements. \\n\\n \\u00a0\\n 64 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\u00a0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n PART II \\n Item 8 \\n \\u00a0\\n\\n We anticipate this standard will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\\nWhile we are continuing to assess all potential impacts of the standard, we currently believe the most significant impact relates to our accounting for office, retail, and datacenter operating leases. \\n\\nFinancial Instruments \\u2013 Recognition, Measurement, Presentation, and Disclosure \\n\\nIn January 2016, the FASB issued a new standard to amend certain aspects of recognition, measurement, presentation, and disclosure of financial\\ninstruments. Most prominent among the amendments is the requirement for changes in the fair value of our equity investments, with certain exceptions, to be recognized through net income rather than OCI. The new standard will be effective for us\\nbeginning July\\u00a01, 2018. The application of the amendments will result in a cumulative-effect adjustment to our consolidated balance sheets as of the effective date. We are currently evaluating the impact of this standard on our consolidated\\nfinancial statements. \\n Revenue from Contracts with Customers \\n In May 2014, the FASB issued a new standard related to revenue recognition. Under the new standard, revenue is recognized when a customer obtains control of promised goods or services and is recognized in an amount\\nthat reflects the consideration which the entity expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. In addition, the standard requires disclosure of the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from\\ncontracts with customers. The FASB has recently issued several amendments to the standard, including clarification on accounting for licenses of intellectual property and identifying performance obligations. \\n\\nThe guidance permits two methods of adoption: retrospectively to each prior reporting period presented (full retrospective method), or\\nretrospectively with the cumulative effect of initially applying the guidance recognized at the date of initial application (the cumulative catch-up transition method). We currently anticipate adopting the standard using the full retrospective\\nmethod to restate each prior reporting period presented. \\n The new standard will be effective for us beginning July\\u00a01, 2018, and\\nadoption as of the original effective date of July\\u00a01, 2017 is permitted. We currently anticipate early adoption of the new standard effective July\\u00a01, 2017. Our ability to early adopt using the full retrospective method is dependent on\\nsystem readiness, including software procured from third-party providers, and the completion of our analysis of information necessary to restate prior period financial statements. \\n\\nWe anticipate this standard will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. While we are continuing to assess all potential\\nimpacts of the standard, we currently believe the most significant impact relates to our accounting for software license revenue. We expect revenue related to hardware, cloud offerings, and professional services to remain substantially unchanged.\\nSpecifically, under the new standard we expect to recognize Windows 10 revenue predominantly at the time of billing rather than ratably over the life of the related device. We also expect to recognize license revenue at the time of billing rather\\nthan over the subscription period from certain multi-year commercial software subscriptions that include both software licenses and Software Assurance. Due to the complexity of certain of our commercial license subscription contracts, the actual\\nrevenue recognition treatment required under the standard will be dependent on contract-specific terms, and may vary in some instances from recognition at the time of billing. \\n We currently believe that the net change in Windows 10 revenue from period to period is indicative of the net change in revenue we expect from the adoption of the new standard. \\n\\nNOTE 2 \\u2014 EARNINGS PER SHARE \\n Basic earnings per share (\\u201cEPS\\u201d) is computed based on the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. Diluted EPS is computed based on the weighted average number of\\nshares of common stock plus the effect of dilutive potential common shares outstanding during the period using the treasury stock method. Dilutive potential common shares include outstanding stock options and stock awards. \\n\\n \\u00a0\\n 65 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\u00a0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n PART II \\n

Our objectives for\\nholding derivatives include reducing, eliminating, and efficiently managing the economic impact of these exposures as effectively as possible. \\n Our derivative programs include strategies that both qualify and do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment. All notional amounts presented below are measured in U.S. dollar equivalents. \\n\\n \\u00a0\\n 68 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\u00a0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n PART II \\n Item 8 \\n \\u00a0\\n\\n Foreign Currency \\n Certain forecasted transactions, assets, and liabilities are exposed to foreign currency risk. We monitor our foreign currency exposures daily to maximize the economic effectiveness of our foreign currency hedge\\npositions. Option and forward contracts are used to hedge a portion of forecasted international revenue for up to three years in the future and are designated as cash flow hedging instruments. Principal currencies hedged include the euro, Japanese\\nyen, British pound, Canadian dollar, and Australian dollar. As of June\\u00a030, 2016 and June\\u00a030, 2015, the total notional amounts of these foreign exchange contracts sold were $8.4 billion and $9.8 billion, respectively. \\n\\nForeign currency risks related to certain non-U.S. dollar denominated securities are hedged using foreign exchange forward contracts that are\\ndesignated as fair value hedging instruments. As of June\\u00a030, 2016 and June\\u00a030, 2015, the total notional amounts of these foreign exchange contracts sold were $5.3 billion for both periods. \\n\\nCertain options and forwards not designated as hedging instruments are also used to manage the variability in foreign exchange rates on certain\\nbalance sheet amounts and to manage other foreign currency exposures.\\u00a0As of June\\u00a030, 2016, the total notional amounts of these foreign exchange contracts purchased and sold were $12.0 billion and $11.7 billion, respectively. As of\\nJune\\u00a030, 2015, the total notional amounts of these foreign exchange contracts purchased and sold were $9.7 billion and $11.0 billion, respectively. \\n\\nEquity \\n Securities held in our equity and\\nother investments portfolio are subject to market price risk.\\u00a0Market price risk is managed relative to broad-based global and domestic equity indices using certain convertible preferred investments, options, futures, and swap contracts not\\ndesignated as hedging instruments. From time to time, to hedge our price risk, we may use and designate equity derivatives as hedging instruments, including puts, calls, swaps, and forwards.\\u00a0As of June\\u00a030, 2016, the total notional amounts\\nof equity contracts purchased and sold for managing market price risk were $1.3 billion and $2.2 billion, respectively, of which $737 million and $986 million, respectively, were designated as hedging instruments. As of June\\u00a030, 2015, the total\\nnotional amounts of equity contracts purchased and sold for managing market price risk were $2.2 billion and $2.6 billion, respectively, of which $1.1 billion and $1.4 billion, respectively, were designated as hedging instruments. \\n\\nInterest Rate \\n Securities held in our\\nfixed-income portfolio are subject to different interest rate risks based on their maturities. We manage the average maturity of our fixed-income portfolio to achieve economic returns that correlate to certain broad-based fixed-income indices using\\nexchange-traded option and futures contracts, and over-the-counter swap and option contracts, none of which are designated as hedging instruments. As of June\\u00a030, 2016, the total notional amounts of fixed-interest rate contracts purchased and\\nsold were $328 million and $2.4 billion, respectively. As of June\\u00a030, 2015, the total notional amounts of fixed-interest rate contracts purchased and sold were $1.0 billion and $3.2 billion, respectively. \\n\\nIn addition, we use \\u201cTo Be Announced\\u201d forward purchase commitments of mortgage-backed assets to gain exposure to agency mortgage-backed\\nsecurities.\\u00a0These meet the definition of a derivative instrument in cases where physical delivery of the assets is not taken at the earliest available delivery date. As of June\\u00a030, 2016 and 2015, the total notional derivative amounts of\\nmortgage contracts purchased were $548 million and $812 million, respectively. \\n Credit \\n\\nOur fixed-income portfolio is diversified and consists primarily of investment-grade securities. We use credit default swap contracts, not\\ndesignated as hedging instruments, to manage credit exposures relative to broad-based indices and to facilitate portfolio diversification. We use credit default swaps as they are a low-cost method of managing exposure to individual credit risks or\\ngroups of credit risks. As of June\\u00a030, 2016, the total notional amounts of credit contracts purchased and sold were $440 million and $273 million, respectively. As of June\\u00a030, 2015, the total notional amounts of credit contracts purchased\\nand sold were $618 million and $430 million, respectively. \\n\\n \\u00a0\\n 69 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\u00a0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n PART II \\n Item 8 \\n \\u00a0\\n\\n Commodity \\n We use broad-based commodity exposures to enhance portfolio returns and to facilitate portfolio diversification. We use swaps, futures, and option contracts, not designated as hedging instruments, to generate and\\nmanage exposures to broad-based commodity indices. We use derivatives on commodities as they can be low-cost alternatives to the purchase and storage of a variety of commodities, including, but not limited to, precious metals, energy, and grain. As\\nof June\\u00a030, 2016, the total notional amounts of commodity contracts purchased and sold were $631 million and $162 million, respectively. As of June\\u00a030, 2015, the total notional amounts of commodity contracts purchased and sold were $882\\nmillion and $316 million, respectively. \\n Credit-Risk-Related Contingent Features \\n\\nCertain of our counterparty agreements for derivative instruments contain provisions that require our issued and outstanding long-term unsecured\\ndebt to maintain an investment grade credit rating and require us to maintain minimum liquidity of $1.0 billion. To the extent we fail to meet these requirements, we will be required to post collateral, similar to the standard convention related to\\nover-the-counter derivatives. As of June\\u00a030, 2016, our long-term unsecured debt rating was AAA, and cash investments were in excess of $1.0 billion. As a result, no collateral was required to be posted. \\n\\n \\u00a0\\n 70 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\u00a0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n PART II \\n Item 8 \\n \\u00a0\\n\\n Fair Values of Derivative Instruments \\n\\nThe following table presents the fair values of derivative instruments designated as hedging instruments (\\u201cdesignated hedge derivatives\\u201d)\\nand not designated as hedging instruments (\\u201cnon-designated hedge derivatives\\u201d).

These amounts are shown in the table below, with the exception of gains (losses) on derivatives presented in income statement line items other than other income (expense), net, which were immaterial for the periods presented. Other than those\\nderivatives entered into for investment purposes, such as commodity contracts, the gains (losses) below are generally economically offset by unrealized gains (losses) in the underlying available-for-sale securities and gains (losses) from foreign\\nexchange rate changes on certain balance sheet amounts. \\n \\u00a0\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t(In

(\\u201cMojang\\u201d), the Swedish video game developer of the Minecraft gaming franchise, for $2.5 billion in cash, net of cash acquired. The addition of Minecraft and its community enhances our\\ngaming portfolio across Windows, Xbox, and other ecosystems besides our own. The significant classes of assets and liabilities to which we allocated the purchase price were goodwill of $1.8 billion and identifiable intangible assets of $928 million,\\nprimarily marketing-related (trade names). The goodwill recognized in connection with the acquisition is primarily attributable to anticipated synergies from future growth, and is not expected to be deductible for tax purposes. We assigned the\\ngoodwill to More Personal Computing under our current segment structure. Identifiable intangible assets were assigned a total weighted-average amortization period of 6.3 years. Mojang has been included in our consolidated results of operations since\\nthe acquisition date. \\n Nokia\\u2019s Devices and Services Business \\n On April\\u00a025, 2014, we acquired substantially all of Nokia Corporation\\u2019s (\\u201cNokia\\u201d) Devices and Services business (\\u201cNDS\\u201d) for a total purchase price of $9.4 billion, including cash\\nacquired of $1.5 billion (the \\u201cAcquisition\\u201d). The purchase price consisted primarily of cash of $7.1 billion and Nokia\\u2019s repurchase of convertible notes of $2.1 billion, which was a non-cash transaction, and liabilities assumed of\\n$0.2 billion. The Acquisition was expected to accelerate the growth of our Devices business through faster innovation, synergies, and unified branding and marketing. \\n The allocation of the purchase price to goodwill was completed as of March\\u00a031, 2015.

The impairment charges for both periods related to our phone business. These costs are included in\\nimpairment, integration, and restructuring expenses on our consolidated income statement. See Note\\u00a010 \\u2013 Goodwill and Note 11 \\u2013 Intangible Assets for additional details. \\n\\nIn May 2016, we announced an agreement to sell our entry-level feature phone assets for $350 million. The transaction is expected to close in the\\nsecond half of calendar year 2016, subject to regulatory approvals and other closing conditions. \\n Our consolidated income statement for\\nfiscal year 2014 included revenue and operating loss of $2.0 billion and $692 million, respectively, attributable to NDS since the Acquisition. \\n Following are the supplemental consolidated results of Microsoft Corporation on an unaudited pro forma basis, as if the Acquisition had been consummated on July\\u00a01, 2012: \\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t(In millions, except per share amounts)\\t\\u00a0\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t\\n\\tYear Ended June\\u00a030,\\t\\u00a0\\u00a0\\t2014\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t Revenue\\n\\t\\u00a0\\u00a0\\t$\\t\\u00a0\\u00a096,248\\t\\u00a0\\u00a0\\n\\t Net income\\n\\t\\u00a0\\u00a0\\t$\\t20,234\\t\\u00a0\\u00a0\\n\\t Diluted earnings per share\\n\\t\\u00a0\\u00a0\\t$\\t2.41\\t\\u00a0\\u00a0\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\n\\n These pro forma results were based on estimates and assumptions, which we believe are reasonable.

The pro forma results include adjustments primarily\\nrelated to purchase accounting adjustments and the elimination of related party transactions between Microsoft and NDS. Acquisition costs and other nonrecurring charges incurred are included in the earliest period presented. \\n\\nDuring the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2014, we incurred $21 million of acquisition costs associated with the purchase of NDS. Acquisition costs\\nare primarily comprised of transaction fees and direct acquisition costs, including legal, finance, consulting, and other professional fees. These costs are included in impairment, integration, and restructuring expenses on our consolidated income\\nstatement for fiscal year 2014. \\n Certain concurrent transactions were recognized separately from the Acquisition. Prior to the\\nAcquisition, we had joint strategic initiatives with Nokia; this contractual relationship was terminated in conjunction with the Acquisition. No gain or loss was recorded upon termination of this agreement, as it was determined to be at market\\nvalue. In addition, we agreed to license Nokia\\u2019s mapping services and will pay Nokia separately for the services provided under a four-year license as they are rendered. \\n Other \\n During fiscal year 2016, we completed 17 acquisitions for total cash consideration of\\n$1.4 billion.

Adjustments in purchase price allocations may require a recasting of the amounts allocated to goodwill retroactive to the periods in\\nwhich the acquisitions occurred. \\n Any change in the goodwill amounts resulting from foreign currency translations and purchase\\naccounting adjustments are presented as \\u201cOther\\u201d in the above table. Also included in \\u201cOther\\u201d are business dispositions and transfers between business segments due to reorganizations, as applicable. For fiscal year 2015, a $5.1\\nbillion goodwill impairment charge was included in \\u201cOther,\\u201d as discussed below. This goodwill impairment charge was included in impairment, integration, and restructuring expenses on our consolidated income statement, and reflected in\\nCorporate and Other in our table of operating income (loss) by segment in Note 21 \\u2013 Segment Information and Geographic Data. \\n Our\\naccumulated goodwill impairment as of both June\\u00a030, 2016 and 2015 was $11.3 billion. \\n As discussed in Note 21 \\u2013 Segment\\nInformation and Geographic Data, during the first quarter of fiscal year 2016 our chief operating decision maker requested changes in the information that he regularly reviews for purposes of allocating resources and assessing performance. This\\nresulted in a change in our operating segments and reporting units. We allocated goodwill to our new reporting units using a relative fair value approach. In addition, we completed an assessment of any potential goodwill impairment for all reporting\\nunits immediately prior to the reallocation and determined that no impairment existed. \\n Goodwill Impairment \\n\\nWe test goodwill for impairment annually on May\\u00a01 at the reporting unit level, primarily using a discounted cash flow methodology with a\\npeer-based, risk-adjusted weighted average cost of capital. We believe use of a discounted cash flow approach is the most reliable indicator of the fair values of the businesses. \\n\\nNo instances of impairment were identified in our May\\u00a01, 2016 test. \\n Upon completion of the annual testing as of May\\u00a01, 2015, our previous Phone Hardware reporting unit goodwill was determined to be impaired. Phone Hardware goodwill is included in the Devices reporting unit\\nwithin More Personal Computing under our current segment structure. In the second half of fiscal year 2015, Phone Hardware did not meet its sales volume and revenue goals, and the mix of units sold had lower margins than planned. These results,\\nalong with changes in the competitive marketplace and an evaluation of business priorities, led to a shift in strategic direction and reduced future revenue and profitability expectations for the business. As a result of these changes in strategy\\nand expectations, we forecasted reductions in unit volume growth rates and lower future cash flows used to estimate the fair value of the Phone Hardware reporting unit, which resulted in the determination that an impairment adjustment was required.\\n\\n Because our annual test indicated that Phone Hardware\\u2019s carrying value exceeded its estimated fair value, a second phase of the\\ngoodwill impairment test (\\u201cStep 2\\u201d) was performed specific to Phone Hardware.

Our foreign regional operating centers, which are taxed at rates lower\\nthan the U.S. rate, generated 69%, 73%, and 81% of our foreign income before tax in fiscal years 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively. In general, other reconciling items consist of interest, U.S. state income taxes, and credits. In fiscal years 2016,\\n2015, and 2014, there were no individually significant other reconciling items. \\n The decrease in our effective tax rate for fiscal year\\n2016 compared to fiscal year 2015 was primarily due to changes in the mix of our income before income taxes between the U.S. and foreign countries, including the net impact of revenue deferrals related to sales of Windows 10, tax benefits from the\\nadoption of the new accounting guidance relating to stock-based compensation, and distributions from foreign affiliates. The fiscal year 2015 effective tax rate included the tax impact of losses in foreign jurisdictions for which we may not realize\\na tax benefit, primarily as a result of impairment and restructuring charges. \\n The components of the deferred income tax assets and\\nliabilities were as follows: \\n \\u00a0\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t(In millions)\\t\\u00a0\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\tJune\\u00a030,\\t\\u00a0\\u00a0\\t2016\\t\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\t2015\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t Deferred Income Tax Assets\\n\\t\\u00a0\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t Stock-based compensation expense\\n\\t\\u00a0\\u00a0\\t$\\t809\\t\\u00a0\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\t$\\t884\\t\\u00a0\\u00a0\\n\\t Other expense items\\n\\t\\u00a0\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\t1,609\\t\\u00a0\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\t1,531\\t\\u00a0\\u00a0\\n\\t Restructuring charges\\n\\t\\u00a0\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\t284\\t\\u00a0\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\t211\\t\\u00a0\\u00a0\\n\\t Unearned revenue\\n\\t\\u00a0\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\t494\\t\\u00a0\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\t520\\t\\u00a0\\u00a0\\n\\t Impaired investments\\n\\t\\u00a0\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\t226\\t\\u00a0\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\t257\\t\\u00a0\\u00a0\\n\\t Loss carryforwards\\n\\t\\u00a0\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\t1,703\\t\\u00a0\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\t1,158\\t\\u00a0\\u00a0\\n\\t Depreciation and amortization\\n\\t\\u00a0\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\t115\\t\\u00a0\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\t798\\t\\u00a0\\u00a0\\n\\t Other revenue items\\n\\t\\u00a0\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\t89\\t\\u00a0\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\t56\\t\\u00a0\\u00a0\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\u00a0\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\n\\t Deferred income tax assets\\n\\t\\u00a0\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\t5,329\\t\\u00a0\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\t5,415\\t\\u00a0\\u00a0\\n\\t Less valuation allowance\\n\\t\\u00a0\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\t(2,180\\t)\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\t(2,265\\t)\\u00a0\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\u00a0\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\n\\t Deferred income tax assets, net of valuation allowance\\n\\t\\u00a0\\u00a0\\t$\\t\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a03,149\\t\\u00a0\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\t$\\t\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a03,150\\t\\u00a0\\u00a0\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\u00a0\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t Deferred Income Tax Liabilities\\n\\t\\u00a0\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t Foreign earnings\\n\\t\\u00a0\\u00a0\\t$\\t(1,242\\t)\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\t$\\t(1,280\\t)\\u00a0\\n\\t Unrealized gain on investments and debt\\n\\t\\u00a0\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\t(2,102\\t)\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\t(2,223\\t)\\u00a0\\n\\t Depreciation and amortization\\n\\t\\u00a0\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\t(1,008\\t)\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\t(685\\t)\\u00a0\\n\\t Other\\n\\t\\u00a0\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\t(54\\t)\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\t(29\\t)\\u00a0\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\u00a0\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\n\\t Deferred income tax liabilities\\n\\t\\u00a0\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\t(4,406\\t)\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\t(4,217\\t)\\u00a0\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\u00a0\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\n\\t Net deferred income tax assets (liabilities)\\n\\t\\u00a0\\u00a0\\t$\\t(1,257\\t)\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\t$\\t(1,067\\t)\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\u00a0\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\u00a0\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t Reported As\\n\\t\\u00a0\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t Other long-term assets\\n(a)\\n\\t\\u00a0\\u00a0\\t$\\t219\\t\\u00a0\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\t$\\t228\\t\\u00a0\\u00a0\\n\\t Long-term deferred income tax liabilities (a) \\n\\t\\u00a0\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\t(1,476\\t)\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\t(1,295\\t)\\u00a0\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\u00a0\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\n\\t Net deferred income tax assets (liabilities) (a)\\n\\t\\u00a0\\u00a0\\t$\\t(1,257\\t)\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\t$\\t(1,067\\t)\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\u00a0\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\u00a0\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\n\\n \\u00a0\\n\\n\\t(a)\\t Balances as of June\\u00a030, 2015 reflect the impact of the adoption of the new accounting standard in fiscal year 2016 related to balance sheet\\nclassification of deferred taxes.

If\\nrecognized, these tax benefits would affect our effective tax rates for fiscal years 2016, 2015, and 2014, by $8.8 billion, $7.9 billion, and $7.0 billion, respectively. \\n As of June\\u00a030, 2016, 2015, and 2014, we had accrued interest expense related to uncertain tax positions of $1.9 billion, $1.7 billion, and $1.5 billion, respectively, net of federal income tax benefits.\\nInterest expense on unrecognized tax benefits was $163 million, $237 million, and $235 million in fiscal years 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively, and was included in provision for income taxes. \\n\\nThe aggregate changes in the balance of unrecognized tax benefits were as follows: \\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t(In millions)\\t\\u00a0\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\tYear Ended June\\u00a030,\\t\\u00a0\\u00a0\\t2016\\t\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\t2015\\t\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\t2014\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t Balance, beginning of year\\n\\t\\u00a0\\u00a0\\t$\\t9,599\\t\\u00a0\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\t$\\t8,714\\t\\u00a0\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\t$\\t8,648\\t\\u00a0\\u00a0\\n\\t Decreases related to settlements\\n\\t\\u00a0\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\t(201\\t)\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\t(50\\t)\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\t(583\\t)\\u00a0\\n\\t Increases for tax positions related to the current year\\n\\t\\u00a0\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\t1,086\\t\\u00a0\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\t1,091\\t\\u00a0\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\t566\\t\\u00a0\\u00a0\\n\\t Increases for tax positions related to prior years\\n\\t\\u00a0\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\t115\\t\\u00a0\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\t94\\t\\u00a0\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\t217\\t\\u00a0\\u00a0\\n\\t Decreases for tax positions related to prior years\\n\\t\\u00a0\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\t(317\\t)\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\t(144\\t)\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\t(95\\t)\\u00a0\\n\\t Decreases due to lapsed statutes of limitations\\n\\t\\u00a0\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\t(118\\t)\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\t(106\\t)\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\t(39\\t)\\u00a0\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\u00a0\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\u00a0\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\n\\t Balance, end of year\\n\\t\\u00a0\\u00a0\\t$\\t\\u00a0\\u00a010,164\\t\\u00a0\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\t$\\t\\u00a0\\u00a09,599\\t\\u00a0\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\t$\\t\\u00a0\\u00a08,714\\t\\u00a0\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\u00a0\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\u00a0\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\u00a0\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\n\\n While we settled a portion of our IRS audit for tax years 2004 to 2006 during the third quarter of fiscal year\\n2011, and settled a portion of the IRS audit for tax years 2007 to 2009 during the first quarter of fiscal year 2016, we remain under audit for those years.

Pursuant to the Phone Hardware Integration Plan, we eliminated approximately\\n19,000 positions in fiscal year 2015, including approximately 13,000 professional and factory positions related to the NDS business. The actions associated with the Phone Hardware Integration Plan were completed as of June\\u00a030, 2015. \\n\\nIn connection with the Phone Hardware Integration Plan, we incurred total restructuring charges of $1.3 billion, including severance expenses and\\nother reorganization costs, primarily associated with our facilities consolidation and write-downs of certain assets. All restructuring charges incurred under the Phone Hardware Integration Plan were recognized in fiscal year 2015. \\n\\nPhone Hardware Restructuring \\n In June 2015,\\nmanagement approved a plan to restructure our phone business to better focus and align resources (the \\u201cPhone Hardware Restructuring Plan\\u201d), under which we eliminated approximately 7,400 positions in fiscal year 2016. \\n\\nIn fiscal year 2015, we incurred restructuring charges of $780 million under the Phone Hardware Restructuring Plan, including severance expenses\\nand other reorganization costs. In fiscal year 2016, we reversed $21 million of previously estimated restructuring charges related to contract termination costs. The actions associated with the Phone Hardware Restructuring Plan were substantially\\ncomplete as of June\\u00a030, 2016, and are expected to be completed by the end of calendar year 2016. \\n 2016 Restructuring \\n\\nWe periodically evaluate how to best deploy the company\\u2019s resources. In the fourth quarter of 2016, management approved restructuring plans\\nthat would result in job eliminations, primarily across our smartphone hardware business and global sales. In addition to the elimination of 1,850 positions that were announced in May 2016, approximately 2,850 roles globally will be reduced during\\nthe year as an extension of the earlier plan, and these actions are expected to be completed by the end of fiscal year 2017. \\n In\\nconnection with the restructuring plans, we incurred restructuring charges of $501 million in fiscal year 2016, including severance expenses and other reorganization costs. We do not expect to incur additional charges for these restructuring plans\\nin subsequent years. \\n Restructuring charges associated with each of these plans were included in impairment, integration, and\\nrestructuring expenses on our consolidated income statement, and reflected in Corporate and Other in our table of operating income (loss) by segment in Note 21\\u2013 Segment Information and Geographic Data. \\n\\nChanges in the restructuring liability were as follows: \\n \\u00a0\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t(In millions)\\t\\u00a0\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\tSeverance\\t\\u00a0\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\tOther\\t\\u00a0(a)\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\tTotal\\t\\u00a0\\u00a0\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t Restructuring liability as of June\\u00a030, 2015\\n\\t\\u00a0\\u00a0\\t$\\t588\\t\\u00a0\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\t$\\t249\\t\\u00a0\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\t$\\t837\\t\\u00a0\\u00a0\\n\\t Restructuring charges\\n\\t\\u00a0\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\t372\\t\\u00a0\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\t129\\t\\u00a0\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\t501\\t\\u00a0\\u00a0\\n\\t Reversal of prior year restructuring charges\\n\\t\\u00a0\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\t0\\t\\u00a0\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\t(21\\t)\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\t(21\\t)\\u00a0\\n\\t Cash paid\\n\\t\\u00a0\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\t(466\\t)\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\t(112\\t)\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\t(578\\t)\\u00a0\\n\\t Other\\n\\t\\u00a0\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\t(24\\t)\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\t(6\\t)\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\t(30\\t)\\u00a0\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\u00a0\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\u00a0\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\n\\t Restructuring liability as of June\\u00a030, 2016\\n\\t\\u00a0\\u00a0\\t$\\t\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0470\\t\\u00a0\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\t$\\t\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0239\\t\\u00a0\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\t$\\t\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0709\\t\\u00a0\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\u00a0\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\u00a0\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\u00a0\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\n\\n \\u00a0\\n\\n\\t(a)\\t \\u201cOther\\u201d primarily reflects activities associated with the consolidation of our facilities and manufacturing operations, including contract\\ntermination costs and asset write-downs. \\n\\n\\n\\n \\u00a0\\n 84 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\u00a0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n PART II \\n Item 8 \\n \\u00a0\\n\\n NOTE 15 \\u2014 UNEARNED REVENUE \\n\\nUnearned revenue by segment was as follows: \\n \\u00a0\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t(In millions)\\t\\u00a0\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\tJune\\u00a030,\\t\\u00a0\\u00a0\\t2016\\t\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\t2015\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t Productivity and Business Processes\\n\\t\\u00a0\\u00a0\\t$\\t12,482\\t\\u00a0\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\t$\\t11,643\\t\\u00a0\\u00a0\\n\\t Intelligent Cloud\\n\\t\\u00a0\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\t11,472\\t\\u00a0\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\t10,346\\t\\u00a0\\u00a0\\n\\t More Personal Computing\\n\\t\\u00a0\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\t3,246\\t\\u00a0\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\t3,246\\t\\u00a0\\u00a0\\n\\t Corporate and Other\\n\\t\\u00a0\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\t6,709\\t\\u00a0\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\t83\\t\\u00a0\\u00a0\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\u00a0\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\n\\t Total\\n\\t\\u00a0\\u00a0\\t$\\t\\u00a0\\u00a033,909\\t\\u00a0\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\t$\\t\\u00a0\\u00a025,318\\t\\u00a0\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\u00a0\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\u00a0\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\n\\n Revenue from Windows 10 is primarily recognized at the time of billing in the More Personal Computing segment, and\\nthe deferral and subsequent recognition of revenue is reflected in Corporate and Other in the table above.

(\\u201cIPCom\\u201d) is a German company that holds a large portfolio of mobile technology-related patents spanning about 170 patent families and addressing a broad range of cellular technologies. IPCom has asserted 19 of these\\npatents in litigation against Nokia and many of the leading cell phone companies and operators. In November 2014, Microsoft and IPCom entered into a standstill agreement staying all of the pending litigation against Microsoft to permit the parties\\nto pursue settlement discussions. \\n InterDigital patent litigation \\n InterDigital Technology Corporation and InterDigital Communications Corporation (collectively, \\u201cIDT\\u201d) filed four patent infringement cases against Nokia in the International Trade Commission\\n(\\u201cITC\\u201d) and in U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware between 2007 and 2013. We have been added to these cases as a defendant. IDT has cases pending against other defendants based on the same patents because most of the patents\\nat issue allegedly relate to 3G and 4G wireless communications standards essential functionality. The cases involving us include three ITC investigations where IDT sought an order excluding importation of 3G and 4G phones into the U.S. and one\\nactive case in U.S. District Court in Delaware seeking an injunction and damages. Each of the ITC matters has been resolved in our favor. In September 2015, in an inter partes review the United States Patent Trial and Appeal Board issued a\\nfinal written decision that deemed unpatentable all asserted claims of the patent remaining at issue in the Delaware case. IDT has appealed this decision to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. The Delaware case has been stayed pending\\nfinal completion of the inter partes review (including appeals and any subsequent proceedings in the Patent Office). We filed an antitrust complaint against IDT in the District of Delaware in August 2015 asserting violations of Section\\u00a02\\nof the Sherman Act, alleging the unlawful exploitation of standard essential patents. IDT filed a motion to dismiss, which the District Court denied. \\n\\nEuropean copyright levies \\n We assumed from\\nNokia all potential liability due to Nokia\\u2019s alleged failure to pay \\u201cprivate copying levies\\u201d in various European countries based upon sale of memory cards and mobile phones that incorporate blank memory.\\u00a0The levies are based upon\\na 2001 European Union (\\u201cEU\\u201d) Directive establishing a right for end users to make copies of copyrighted works for personal or private use, but also allowing the collection of levies based upon sales of blank media or recording devices to\\ncompensate copyright holders for private copying.\\u00a0Various collecting societies in EU countries initiated litigation against Nokia, stating that Nokia must pay levies not only based upon sales of blank memory cards, but also phones that include\\nblank memory for data storage on the phones, regardless of actual usage of that memory.\\u00a0The most significant cases against Nokia are pending in Germany and Austria, due to both the high volume of sales and high levy amounts sought in these\\ncountries. In December 2015, the industry group BITKOM, of which we are a member, reached a settlement with the German collecting society for all claims from 2008 forward, leaving litigation only for the period 2004-2007 pending in Germany. In\\naddition, the industry is engaged in settlement negotiations with the Austrian collecting society. We have also settled copyright levies litigation in Spain and France. \\n Other patent and intellectual property claims \\n In addition to these cases, there were 54 other\\npatent infringement cases pending against Microsoft as of June\\u00a030, 2016. \\n Antitrust, Unfair Competition, and Overcharge Class Actions\\n\\n Antitrust and unfair competition class action lawsuits were filed against us in British Columbia, Ontario, and Quebec, Canada. All\\nthree have been certified on behalf of Canadian indirect purchasers who acquired licenses for Microsoft operating system software and/or productivity application software between 1998 and 2010. \\n\\n \\u00a0\\n 86 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\u00a0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n PART II \\n Item 8 \\n \\u00a0\\n\\n The trial of the British Columbia action commenced in May 2016. The plaintiffs are expected to\\nfile their case in chief in August 2016, setting out claims made, authorities, and evidence in support.\\u00a0A six-month oral hearing is scheduled to commence in September 2017, consisting of cross examination on witness affidavits. The Ontario and\\nQuebec cases are inactive. \\n Other Antitrust Litigation and Claims \\n China State Administration for Industry and Commerce investigation  \\n In 2014, Microsoft\\nwas informed that China\\u2019s State Administration for Industry and Commerce (\\u201cSAIC\\u201d) had begun a formal investigation relating to China\\u2019s Anti-Monopoly Law, and the SAIC conducted onsite inspections of Microsoft offices in Beijing,\\nShanghai, Guangzhou, and Chengdu.\\u00a0SAIC has stated the investigation relates to compatibility, bundle sales, file verification issues related to Windows and Office software, and potentially other issues. \\n\\nProduct-Related Litigation \\n U.S. cell phone litigation\\n\\n Nokia, along with other handset manufacturers and network operators, is a defendant in 19 lawsuits filed in the Superior Court for\\nthe District of Columbia by individual plaintiffs who allege that radio emissions from cellular handsets caused their brain tumors and other adverse health effects. We assumed responsibility for these claims as part of the NDS acquisition and have\\nbeen substituted for the Nokia defendants. Nine of these cases were filed in 2002 and are consolidated for certain pre-trial proceedings; the remaining 10 cases are stayed. In a separate 2009 decision, the Court of Appeals for the District of\\nColumbia held that adverse health effect claims arising from the use of cellular handsets that operate within the U.S. Federal Communications Commission radio frequency emission guidelines (\\u201cFCC Guidelines\\u201d) are pre-empted by federal law.\\nThe plaintiffs allege that their handsets either operated outside the FCC Guidelines or were manufactured before the FCC Guidelines went into effect. The lawsuits also allege an industry-wide conspiracy to manipulate the science and testing around\\nemission guidelines. \\n In 2013, defendants in the consolidated cases moved to exclude plaintiffs\\u2019 expert evidence of general\\ncausation on the basis of flawed scientific methodologies. In 2014, the court granted in part defendants\\u2019 motion to exclude plaintiffs\\u2019 general causation experts. The plaintiffs filed an interlocutory appeal challenging the standard for\\nevaluating expert scientific evidence, which the District of Columbia Court of Appeals agreed to hear en banc. Trial court proceedings are stayed pending resolution of the appeal. \\n Canadian cell phone class action \\n Nokia, along with other handset manufacturers and network\\noperators, is a defendant in a 2013 class action lawsuit filed in the Supreme Court of British Columbia by a purported class of Canadians who have used cellular phones for at least 1,600 hours, including a subclass of users with brain tumors.\\nMicrosoft was served with the complaint in June 2014 and has been substituted for the Nokia defendants. The litigation is not yet active as several defendants remain to be served. \\n Other \\n We also are subject to a variety of other claims and suits that arise from time to time\\nin the ordinary course of our business. Although management currently believes that resolving claims against us, individually or in aggregate, will not have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial statements, these matters are\\nsubject to inherent uncertainties and management\\u2019s view of these matters may change in the future. \\n As of June\\u00a030, 2016, we\\naccrued aggregate legal liabilities of $521 million in other current liabilities. While we intend to defend these matters vigorously, adverse outcomes that we estimate could reach approximately $1.6 billion in aggregate beyond recorded amounts are\\nreasonably possible. Were unfavorable final outcomes to occur, there exists the possibility of a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial statements for the period in which the effects become reasonably estimable. \\n\\n \\u00a0\\n 87 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\u00a0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n PART II \\n Item 8 \\n \\u00a0\\n\\n Indemnifications \\n We provide indemnifications of varying scope and size to certain customers against claims of intellectual property infringement made by third parties arising from the use of our products and certain other matters.\\nAdditionally, we have agreed to cover damages resulting from breaches of certain security and privacy commitments in our cloud business. We evaluate estimated losses for these indemnifications, and we consider such factors as the degree of\\nprobability of an unfavorable outcome and the ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss. To date, we have not encountered significant costs as a result of these obligations and have not accrued any liabilities related to these\\nindemnifications on our consolidated financial statements. \\n\\n NOTE 18 \\u2014 STOCKHOLDERS\\u2019 EQUITY \\n\\n Shares Outstanding \\n\\nShares of common stock outstanding were as follows: \\n \\u00a0\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t(In millions)\\t\\u00a0\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\tYear Ended June\\u00a030,\\t\\u00a0\\u00a0\\t2016\\t\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\t2015\\t\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\t2014\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t Balance, beginning of year\\n\\t\\u00a0\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\t8,027\\t\\u00a0\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\t8,239\\t\\u00a0\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\t8,328\\t\\u00a0\\u00a0\\n\\t Issued\\n\\t\\u00a0\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\t75\\t\\u00a0\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\t83\\t\\u00a0\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\t86\\t\\u00a0\\u00a0\\n\\t Repurchased\\n\\t\\u00a0\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\t(294\\t)\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\t(295\\t)\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\t(175\\t)\\u00a0\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\u00a0\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\u00a0\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\n\\t Balance, end of year\\n\\t\\u00a0\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\t7,808\\t\\u00a0\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\t8,027\\t\\u00a0\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\t8,239\\t\\u00a0\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\t\\u00a0\\u00a0\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\u00a0\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\u00a0\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\n\\n Share Repurchases \\n On September\\u00a016, 2013, our Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program authorizing up to $40.0 billion in share repurchases.

Beginning January 2016, we contribute fifty cents for each dollar a participant contributes in this plan, with a maximum employer contribution of 50% of the IRS contribution limit for the calendar year. Prior to January 2016, we\\ncontributed fifty cents for each dollar of the first 6% a participant contributed in this plan, with a maximum contribution of the lesser of 3% of a participant\\u2019s earnings or 3% of the IRS compensation limit for the calendar year.

During\\nthe first quarter of fiscal year 2016, our chief operating decision maker requested changes in the information that he regularly reviews for purposes of allocating resources and assessing performance. As a result, beginning in fiscal year 2016, we\\nreport our financial performance based on our new segments, Productivity and Business Processes, Intelligent Cloud, and More Personal Computing, and analyze operating income as the measure of segment profitability. We have recast certain prior\\nperiod amounts to conform to the way we internally manage and monitor segment performance. \\n Our reportable segments are described below.\\n\\n Productivity and Business Processes \\n Our Productivity and Business Processes segment consists of products and services in our portfolio of productivity, communication, and information services, spanning a variety of devices and platforms. This segment\\nprimarily comprises: \\n \\u00a0\\n\\n\\t\\u00a0\\t\\u2022\\t\\u00a0\\t Office Commercial, including volume licensing and subscriptions to Office 365 commercial for products and services such as Office, Exchange, SharePoint, and\\nSkype for Business, and related Client Access Licenses (\\u201cCALs\\u201d). \\n\\n\\n \\u00a0\\n\\n\\t\\u00a0\\t\\u2022\\t\\u00a0\\t Office Consumer, including Office sold through retail or through an Office 365 consumer subscription, and Office Consumer Services, including Skype,\\nOutlook.com, and OneDrive. \\n\\n\\n \\u00a0\\n\\n\\t\\u00a0\\t\\u2022\\t\\u00a0\\t Dynamics business solutions, including Dynamics ERP products, Dynamics CRM on-premises, and Dynamics CRM Online. \\n\\n\\n\\n \\u00a0\\n 91 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\u00a0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n PART II \\n Item 8 \\n \\u00a0\\n\\n Intelligent Cloud \\n Our Intelligent Cloud segment consists of our public, private, and hybrid server products and cloud services that can power modern business. This segment primarily comprises: \\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\t\\u00a0\\t\\u2022\\t\\u00a0\\t Server products and cloud services, including Microsoft SQL Server, Windows Server, Visual Studio, System Center, and related CALs, as well as Azure.\\n\\n\\n\\n \\u00a0\\n\\n\\t\\u00a0\\t\\u2022\\t\\u00a0\\t Enterprise Services, including Premier Support Services and Microsoft Consulting Services. \\n\\n\\n\\nMore Personal Computing \\n Our More Personal\\nComputing segment consists of products and services geared towards harmonizing the interests of end users, developers, and IT professionals across screens of all sizes. This segment primarily comprises: \\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\t\\u00a0\\t\\u2022\\t\\u00a0\\t Windows, including Windows original equipment manufacturer licensing (\\u201cWindows OEM\\u201d) and other non-volume licensing of the Windows operating system,\\nvolume licensing of the Windows operating system, patent licensing, Windows Embedded, MSN display advertising, and Windows Phone licensing. \\n\\n\\n \\u00a0\\n\\n\\t\\u00a0\\t\\u2022\\t\\u00a0\\t Devices, including Surface, phones, and PC accessories. \\n\\n\\n \\u00a0\\n\\n\\t\\u00a0\\t\\u2022\\t\\u00a0\\t Gaming, including Xbox hardware; Xbox Live, comprising transactions, subscriptions, and advertising; video games; and third-party video game royalties.\\n\\n\\n\\n \\u00a0\\n\\n\\t\\u00a0\\t\\u2022\\t\\u00a0\\t Search advertising. \\n\\n\\n\\nRevenue and costs are generally directly attributed to our segments. However, due to the integrated structure of our business, certain revenue\\nrecognized and costs incurred by one segment may benefit other segments. Revenue on certain contracts is allocated among the segments based on the relative value of the underlying products and services, which can include allocation based on actual\\nprices charged, prices when sold separately, or estimated costs plus a profit margin. Cost of revenue is allocated in certain cases based on a relative revenue methodology. Operating expenses that are allocated primarily include those relating to\\nmarketing of products and services from which multiple segments benefit, and are generally allocated based on relative gross margin. \\n In\\naddition, certain costs incurred at a corporate level that are identifiable and that benefit our segments are allocated to them.

consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, cash flows, and stockholders\\u2019 equity for each of the three years in the period\\nended June\\u00a030, 2016.\\u00a0These financial

Based on that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that these disclosure controls and procedures are effective. \\n\\n[bookmark: tx187868_15]REPORT OF MANAGEMENT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING \\n\\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting for the company. Internal control\\nover financial reporting is a process to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial reporting for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Internal\\ncontrol over financial reporting includes maintaining records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect our transactions; providing reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary for preparation of our financial\\nstatements; providing reasonable assurance that receipts and expenditures of company assets are made in accordance with management authorization; and providing reasonable assurance that unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of company assets\\nthat could have a material effect on our financial statements would be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting is not intended to provide absolute assurance that a\\nmisstatement of our financial statements would be prevented or detected. \\n Management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our\\ninternal control over financial reporting based on the framework in Internal Control \\u2013 Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on this evaluation, management\\nconcluded that the company\\u2019s internal control over financial reporting was effective as of June\\u00a030, 2016. There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended June\\u00a030, 2016 that have\\nmaterially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. Deloitte\\u00a0& Touche LLP has audited our internal control over financial reporting as of June\\u00a030, 2016; their report is\\nincluded in Item\\u00a09A. \\n\\n \\u00a0\\n 96 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\u00a0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n PART II \\n Item 9A \\n \\u00a0\\n\\n R[bookmark: tx187868_16]EPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM \\n\\nTo the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Microsoft Corporation \\n Redmond, Washington \\n We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of Microsoft\\nCorporation and subsidiaries (the \\u201cCompany\\u201d) as of June\\u00a030, 2016, based on criteria established in Internal Control \\u2013 Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway\\nCommission.\\u00a0The Company\\u2019s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying\\nReport of Management on Internal Control over Financial Reporting.\\u00a0Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company\\u2019s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. \\n\\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).\\u00a0Those standards\\nrequire that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\\u00a0Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal\\ncontrol over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered\\nnecessary in the circumstances.\\u00a0We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. \\n A company\\u2019s internal\\ncontrol over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the company\\u2019s principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by the company\\u2019s board of\\ndirectors, management, and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting\\nprinciples.\\u00a0A company\\u2019s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and\\ndispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and\\nexpenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or\\ndisposition of the company\\u2019s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. \\n Because of the inherent\\nlimitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.\\u00a0Also,\\nprojections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance\\nwith the policies or procedures may deteriorate. \\n In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal\\ncontrol over financial reporting as of June\\u00a030, 2016, based on the criteria established in Internal Control \\u2013 Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. \\n\\nWe have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated financial\\nstatements as of and for the year ended June\\u00a030, 2016 of the Company and our report dated July\\u00a028, 2016 expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements. \\n /S/\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0DELOITTE\\u00a0& TOUCHE LLP \\n\\nSeattle, Washington \\n July\\u00a028,\\n2016 \\n\\n \\u00a0\\n 97 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\u00a0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n PART II, III \\n Item 9B, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14 \\n \\u00a0\\n\\n I[bookmark: tx187868_17]TEM 9B.

BUSINESS \\nGENERAL \\nOur vision\\nMicrosoft is a technology company whose mission is to empower every person and every organization on the planet to achieve more. We strive to create local opportunity, growth, and impact in every country around the world. Our strategy is to build best-in-class platforms and productivity services for an intelligent cloud and an intelligent edge infused with artificial intelligence (\\u201cAI\\u201d). \\nThe way individuals and organizations use and interact with technology continues to evolve. A person\\u2019s experience with technology increasingly spans a multitude of devices and becomes more natural and multi-sensory with voice, ink, and gaze interactions. We believe a new technology paradigm is emerging that manifests itself through an intelligent cloud and an intelligent edge where computing is more distributed, AI drives insights and acts on the user\\u2019s behalf, and user experiences span devices with a user\\u2019s available data and information. We continue to transform our business to lead this new era of digital transformation and enable our customers and partners to thrive in this evolving world. \\nWhat we offer\\nFounded in 1975, we operate worldwide in over 190 countries. We develop, license, and support a wide range of software products, services, and devices that deliver new opportunities, greater convenience, and enhanced value to people\\u2019s lives. Our platforms and tools help drive small business productivity, large business competitiveness, and public-sector efficiency. They also support new startups, improve educational and health outcomes, and empower human ingenuity.\\nOur products include operating systems; cross-device productivity applications; server applications; business solution applications; desktop and server management tools; software development tools; video games; and training and certification of computer system integrators and developers. We also design, manufacture, and sell devices, including PCs, tablets, gaming and entertainment consoles, other intelligent devices, and related accessories, that integrate with our cloud-based offerings. We offer an array of services, including cloud-based solutions that provide customers with software, services, platforms, and content, and we provide solution support and consulting services. We also deliver relevant online advertising to a global audience. \\nThe ambitions that drive us\\nTo achieve our vision, our research and development efforts focus on three interconnected ambitions: \\n\\u00b7 Reinvent productivity and business processes. \\n\\u00b7 Build the intelligent cloud platform.\\n\\u00b7 Create more personal computing.\\nReinvent productivity and business processes \\nWe believe we can significantly enhance the lives of our customers using our broad portfolio of productivity, communication, and information products and services that span platforms and devices. Productivity is our first and foremost objective, to enable people to meet and collaborate more easily, and to effectively express ideas in new ways. We invent new scenarios that in turn create opportunity for our partners and help businesses accelerate their digital transformation while respecting each person\\u2019s privacy choices. \\nThe foundation for these efforts rests on advancing our leading productivity, collaboration, communication, and business process tools including Microsoft Office, Microsoft Dynamics, and LinkedIn. With Office 365, we provide familiar industry-leading productivity and business process tools as cloud services, enabling access from anywhere and any device.\\u00a0New scenarios \\u2013 like those enabled by Microsoft Teams \\u2013 will redefine how work gets done and help foster employee engagement and culture. This work creates an opportunity to reach new customers and expand the usage of our services by our existing customers. We see opportunity in combining our offerings in new ways that are mobile, secure, collaborative, intelligent, and trustworthy. We offer our services across platforms and devices outside our own. As people move from device to device, so does their content and the richness of their services. We engineer our applications so users can find, try, and buy them in friction-free ways.\\nOn December 8, 2016, we completed our acquisition of LinkedIn Corporation, the world\\u2019s largest professional network on the Internet. The acquisition is expected to accelerate the growth of Office 365, Dynamics 365, and LinkedIn.\\nBuild the intelligent cloud platform \\nCloud computing is foundational to enabling any organization\\u2019s digital transformation. In deploying technology that advances business strategy, enterprises decide what solutions will make employees more productive, collaborative, and satisfied, and connect with customers in new and compelling ways. Enterprises work to unlock business insights from a world of data. To achieve these objectives, they increasingly look to leverage the benefits of the cloud. Helping businesses digitally transform and move to the cloud is one of our largest opportunities. As one of the two largest providers of cloud computing at scale, we believe we work from a position of strength. The Microsoft Cloud is a secure solution that can listen, learn, and predict;\\u00a0turning data into actionable insight that enhances\\u00a0business opportunities. It provides a scalable and complete collaboration suite that transforms the way teams work. With the cloud, high-performance computing and agility can help businesses expand their growth.\\nOur cloud business benefits from three economies of scale: larger datacenters that deploy computational resources at significantly lower cost per unit than smaller ones; larger datacenters that coordinate and aggregate diverse customer, geographic, and application demand patterns, improving the utilization of computing, storage, and network resources; and multi-tenancy locations that lower application maintenance labor costs. \\n[bookmark: _Hlk488564532]We believe our server products and cloud services, which include Microsoft SQL Server, Windows Server, Visual Studio, System Center, and Microsoft Azure, make us the only company with a public, private, and hybrid cloud platform that can power modern business. What differentiates Azure is our hybrid consistency, developer productivity, and software-as-a-service (\\u201cSaaS\\u201d) application integration. In addition, our hybrid infrastructure spans identity, data, compute, management, and security, helping to support the real-world needs and evolving regulatory requirements of commercial customers and enterprise-focused SaaS partners. We are working to enhance the customer\\u2019s return on investment by enabling enterprises to combine their existing datacenters and our public cloud into a single cohesive infrastructure. Businesses can deploy applications in their own datacenter, a partner\\u2019s datacenter, or in our datacenters with common security, management, and administration across all environments, providing the flexibility and scale they want. AI will be pervasive across devices, applications, and infrastructure to drive insights and act on the user\\u2019s behalf. Azure is also unique in its support for emerging applications so that Internet of Things (\\u201cIoT\\u201d) devices can act locally at the edge while taking advantage of the cloud for global coordination and machine learning at scale.\\nWe enable organizations to securely adopt SaaS applications, both our own and third-party, and integrate them with their existing security and management infrastructure. We continue to innovate with higher-level services including identity and directory services that manage employee corporate identity and manage and secure corporate information accessed and stored across a growing number of devices, rich data storage and analytics services, machine learning services, media services, web and mobile backend services, and developer productivity services. To foster a rich developer ecosystem, our platform is extensible, enabling customers and partners to further customize and enhance our solutions, achieving even more value. This strategy requires continuing investment in datacenters and other infrastructure to support our services. \\nCreate more personal computing\\nWe strive to make computing more personal by putting users at the core of the experience, enabling them to interact with technology in more intuitive, engaging, and dynamic ways. Windows\\u00a010 is the cornerstone of our ambition to create more personal computing, allowing us to move from an operating system that runs on a PC to a service that can power the full spectrum of devices.

Our devices are designed to enable people and organizations to connect to the people and content that matter most using Windows and integrated Microsoft products and services. Surface is designed to help organizations, students, and consumers be more productive. We released the Surface Studio in December 2016 and our latest Surface devices, the Surface Laptop and Surface Pro, in June 2017. \\nIn July 2015, we announced a plan to restructure our phone business to better focus and align resources. In May 2016, we announced plans to further streamline our smartphone hardware business. In November 2016, we completed the sale of our feature phone business. \\nGaming\\nOur gaming platform is designed to provide a unique variety of entertainment using our devices, peripherals, applications, online services, and content. We released Xbox One and Xbox One S in November\\u00a02013 and August 2016, respectively, and announced Xbox One X in June 2017. With the launch of the Windows 10 Xbox app in July 2015, and the launch of the Mixer service in May 2017, we continue to open new opportunities for customers to engage both on- and off-console. Xbox Live enables people to connect and share online gaming experiences and is accessible on Xbox consoles, Windows-enabled devices, and other devices.\\u00a0Xbox Live is designed to benefit users by providing access to a network of certified applications and services and to benefit our developer and partner ecosystems by providing access to a large customer base. Xbox Live revenue is mainly affected by subscriptions and sales of Xbox Live enabled content, as well as advertising. We also design and sell gaming content to showcase our unique platform capabilities for Xbox consoles, Windows-enabled devices, and other devices. Growth of our gaming business is determined by the overall active user base through Xbox Live enabled content, availability of games, providing exclusive game content that gamers seek, the computational power and reliability of the devices used to access our content and services, and the ability to create new experiences via online services, downloadable content, and peripherals. \\nSearch Advertising\\nSearch advertising, including Bing and Bing Ads, is designed to deliver relevant online advertising to a global audience. We have several partnerships with other companies, including Oath (formerly Yahoo! and AOL) which is owned by Verizon, through which we provide and monetize search queries. Growth depends on our ability to attract new users, understand intent, and match intent with relevant content and advertiser offerings. \\nCompetition \\nWindows faces competition from various software products and from alternative platforms and devices, mainly from Apple and Google.

The lifecycle for gaming and entertainment consoles averages five to ten years. Nintendo released its latest generation console in March 2017 and Sony released its latest generation console in November 2013. We also compete with other providers of entertainment services through online marketplaces.\\u00a0We believe our gaming platform is effectively positioned against competitive products and services based on significant innovation in hardware architecture, user interface, developer tools, online gaming and entertainment services, and continued strong exclusive content from our own game franchises as well as other digital content offerings. Our video games competitors include Electronic Arts and Activision Blizzard. Xbox Live faces competition from various online marketplaces, including those operated by Amazon, Apple, and Google.\\nOur search advertising business competes with Google and a wide array of websites, social platforms like Facebook, and portals that provide content and online offerings to end users. \\nOPERATIONS \\nWe have operations centers that support operations in their regions, including customer contract and order processing, credit and collections, information processing, and vendor management and logistics. The regional center in Ireland supports the European, Middle Eastern, and African region; the center in Singapore supports the Japan, India, Greater China, and Asia-Pacific region; and the centers in Fargo, North Dakota, Fort Lauderdale, Florida, Puerto Rico, Redmond, Washington, and Reno, Nevada support Latin America and North America. In addition to the operations centers, we also operate datacenters throughout the Americas, Australia, Europe, and Asia. \\nTo serve the needs of customers around the world and to improve the quality and usability of products in international markets, we localize many of our products to reflect local languages and conventions. Localizing a product may require modifying the user interface, altering dialog boxes, and translating text. \\nOur devices are primarily manufactured by third-party contract manufacturers. We generally have the ability to use other manufacturers if a current vendor becomes unavailable or unable to meet our requirements. \\nWe sold our feature phone business in November 2016, which included the sale of our phone manufacturing facility in Vietnam. \\n[bookmark: _Hlk484675431]RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT \\nDuring fiscal years 2017, 2016, and 2015, research and development expense was $13.0 billion, $12.0 billion, and $12.0\\u00a0billion, respectively. These amounts represented 14%, 14%, and 13% of revenue in fiscal years 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively. We plan to continue to make significant investments in a broad range of research and development efforts. \\nProduct and Service Development, and Intellectual Property \\nWe develop most of our products and services internally through the following engineering groups. \\n\\u00b7 Office Product Group, focuses on our business across productivity, communications, education, and other information applications and services.\\n\\u00b7 Artificial Intelligence and Research, focuses on our AI development and other forward-looking research and development efforts spanning infrastructure, services, applications, and search.\\n\\u00b7 Cloud and Enterprise, focuses on our cloud infrastructure, server, database, CRM, ERP, management and development tools, and other business process applications and services for enterprises. \\n\\u00b7 Windows and Devices Group, focuses on our Windows platform, applications, games, store, and devices that power the Windows ecosystem.\\n\\u00b7 LinkedIn, focuses on our services that transform the way customers hire, market, sell, and learn.  \\nInternal development allows us to maintain competitive advantages that come from product differentiation and closer technical control over our products and services. It also gives us the freedom to decide which modifications and enhancements are most important and when they should be implemented. We strive to obtain information as early as possible about changing usage patterns and hardware advances that may affect software design. Before releasing new software platforms, we provide application vendors with a range of resources and guidelines for development, training, and testing. Generally, we also create product documentation internally. \\nWe protect our intellectual property investments in a variety of ways. We work actively in the U.S. and internationally to ensure the enforcement of copyright, trademark, trade secret, and other protections that apply to our software and hardware products, services, business plans, and branding. We are a leader among technology companies in pursuing patents and currently have a portfolio of over 66,000 U.S. and international patents issued and over 35,000 pending. While we employ much of our internally developed intellectual property exclusively in our products and services, we also engage in outbound and inbound licensing of specific patented technologies that are incorporated into licensees\\u2019 or Microsoft\\u2019s products. From time to time, we enter into broader cross-license agreements with other technology companies covering entire groups of patents. We also purchase or license technology that we incorporate into our products and services. At times, we make select intellectual property broadly available at no or low cost to achieve a strategic objective, such as promoting industry standards, advancing interoperability, or attracting and enabling our external development community. \\nWhile it may be necessary in the future to seek or renew licenses relating to various aspects of our products, services, and business methods, we believe, based upon past experience and industry practice, such licenses generally can be obtained on commercially reasonable terms. We believe our continuing research and product development are not materially dependent on any single license or other agreement with a third party relating to the development of our products. \\nInvesting in the Future \\nOur success is based on our ability to create new and compelling products, services, and experiences for our users, to initiate and embrace disruptive technology trends, to enter new geographic and product markets, and to drive broad adoption of our products and services. We invest in a range of emerging technology trends and breakthroughs that we believe offer significant opportunities to deliver value to our customers and growth for the company. Based on our assessment of key technology trends, we maintain our long-term commitment to research and development across a wide spectrum of technologies, tools, and platforms spanning digital work and life experiences, cloud computing, AI, and hardware operating systems.\\nWhile our main research and development facilities are located in Redmond, Washington, we also operate research and development facilities in other parts of the U.S. and around the world, including Canada, China, India, Ireland, Israel, and the United Kingdom. This global approach helps us remain competitive in local markets and enables us to continue to attract top talent from across the world. We generally fund research at the corporate level to ensure that we are looking beyond immediate product considerations to opportunities further in the future. We also fund research and development activities at the operating segment level. Much of our segment level research and development is coordinated with other segments and leveraged across the company. \\nIn addition to our main research and development operations, we also operate Microsoft Research. Microsoft Research is one of the world\\u2019s largest computer science research organizations, and works in close collaboration with top universities around the world to advance the state-of-the-art in computer science, providing us a unique perspective on future technology trends and contributing to our innovation. \\n[bookmark: _Hlk487030805][bookmark: _Hlk487116617][bookmark: _Hlk485732954]DISTRIBUTION, SALES, AND MARKETING \\nWe market and distribute our products and services through the following channels: OEMs, direct, and distributors and resellers. Our sales force performs a variety of functions, including working directly with enterprises and public-sector organizations worldwide to identify and meet their technology requirements; managing OEM relationships; and supporting system integrators, independent software vendors, and other partners who engage directly with our customers to perform sales, consulting, and fulfillment functions for our products and services.\\nOEMs \\nWe distribute our software through OEMs that pre-install our software on new devices and servers they sell. The largest component of the OEM business is the Windows operating system pre-installed on devices. OEMs also sell devices pre-installed with other Microsoft products and services, including applications such as Office and the capability to subscribe to Office 365. \\nThere are two broad categories of OEMs. The largest category of OEMs are direct OEMs as our relationship with them is managed through a direct agreement between Microsoft and the OEM. We have distribution agreements covering one or more of our products with virtually all the multinational OEMs, including Acer, ASUS, Dell, Fujitsu, Hewlett-Packard, Lenovo, Samsung, Toshiba, and with many regional and local OEMs. The second broad category of OEMs are system builders consisting of lower-volume PC manufacturers, which source Microsoft software for pre-installation and local redistribution primarily through the Microsoft distributor channel rather than through a direct agreement or relationship with Microsoft. \\nDirect \\nMany organizations that license our products and services transact directly with us through Enterprise Agreements and Enterprise Services contracts, with sales support from system integrators, independent software vendors, web agencies, and partners that advise organizations on licensing our products and services (\\u201cEnterprise Agreement Software Advisors\\u201d, or \\u201cESA\\u201d). Microsoft offers direct sales programs targeted to reach small, medium, and corporate customers, in addition to those offered through the reseller channel. A large network of partner advisors support many of these sales.  \\nWe also provide commercial and consumer products and services directly to customers, such as cloud services, search, and gaming, through our online portals, marketplaces, and retail stores. \\n[bookmark: _Hlk485732629]Distributors and Resellers \\n[bookmark: _Hlk488312999]Organizations also license our products and services indirectly, primarily through licensing solution partners (\\u201cLSP\\u201d), distributors, value-added resellers (\\u201cVAR\\u201d), OEMs, and retailers. Although each type of reselling partner may reach organizations of all sizes, LSPs are primarily engaged with large organizations, distributors resell primarily to VARs, and VARs typically reach small and medium organizations. ESAs are also typically authorized as LSPs and operate as resellers for our other volume licensing programs. Microsoft Cloud Solution Provider is our main partner program for reselling cloud services. \\nOur Dynamics software offerings are also licensed to enterprises through a global network of channel partners providing vertical solutions and specialized services. We distribute our retail packaged products primarily through independent non-exclusive distributors, authorized replicators, resellers, and retail outlets. Individual consumers obtain these products primarily through retail outlets. We distribute our devices through third-party retailers. We have a network of field sales representatives and field support personnel that solicit orders from distributors and resellers, and provide product training and sales support. \\nLICENSING OPTIONS \\nWe offer options for organizations that want to purchase our cloud services, on-premises software, and Software Assurance. We license software to organizations under volume licensing agreements to allow the customer to acquire multiple licenses of products and services instead of having to acquire separate licenses through retail channels. We use different programs designed to provide flexibility for organizations of various sizes. While these programs may differ in various parts of the world, generally they include those discussed below. \\nSoftware Assurance conveys rights to new software and upgrades for perpetual licenses released over the contract period. It also provides support, tools, and training to help customers deploy and use software efficiently. Software Assurance is included with certain volume licensing agreements and is an optional purchase with others.\\nVolume Licensing Programs\\nEnterprise Agreement \\nEnterprise Agreements offer large organizations a manageable volume licensing program that gives them the flexibility to buy cloud services and software licenses under one agreement.

Software Assurance is included. \\nMicrosoft Product and Services Agreement \\nMPSAs are designed for medium and large organizations that want to license cloud services and on-premises software as needed, with no organization-wide commitment, under a single, non-expiring agreement. Organizations purchase perpetual licenses or subscribe to licenses. Software Assurance is optional for customers that purchase perpetual licenses. \\nOpen\\n[bookmark: _Hlk488051513]Open Licensing agreements are a simple, cost-effective way to acquire the latest Microsoft technology. Open Licensing agreements are designed for small and medium organizations that want to license cloud services and on-premises software over a one- to three-year period. Under the Open License program, organizations purchase perpetual licenses and Software Assurance is optional. Under Open Value programs, organizations can elect to purchase perpetual licenses or subscribe to licenses and Software Assurance is included. \\nSelect Plus \\nSelect Plus agreements are designed for government and academic organizations to acquire on-premises licenses at any affiliate or department level, while realizing advantages as one organization. Organizations purchase perpetual licenses and Software Assurance is optional.  \\nIn July 2014, we announced the retirement over a two-year period of Select Plus agreements for commercial organizations. Beginning July 2015, no new Select Plus agreements were signed with commercial organizations. Starting in July 2016, we no longer accept orders from commercial organizations for Select Plus after their next agreement anniversary. \\nMicrosoft Online Subscription Agreement \\nMicrosoft Online Subscription Agreement is designed for small and medium organizations that want to subscribe to, activate, provision, and maintain cloud services seamlessly and directly via the web, through the Microsoft Online Subscription Program. The program allows customers to acquire monthly or annual subscriptions for cloud-based services. \\nPartner Programs \\nThe Microsoft Cloud Solution Provider program offers customers an easy way to license the cloud services they need in combination with the value-added services offered by their systems integrator, hosting partner, or cloud reseller partner. Partners in this program can easily package their own products and services to directly provision, manage, and support their customer subscriptions.  \\nThe Microsoft Services Provider License Agreement allows service providers and independent software vendors who want to license eligible Microsoft software products to provide software services and hosted applications to their end customers. Partners license software over a three-year period and are billed monthly based on consumption. \\nThe Independent Software Vendor Royalty program enables partners to integrate Microsoft products into other applications and then license the unified business solution to their end users. \\nCUSTOMERS \\nOur customers include individual consumers, small and medium organizations, large global enterprises, public-sector institutions, Internet service providers, application developers, and OEMs. No sales to an individual customer accounted for more than 10% of revenue in fiscal years 2017, 2016, or 2015. Our practice is to ship our products promptly upon receipt of purchase orders from customers; consequently, backlog is not significant. \\n[bookmark: EXECUTIVE_FICERS__REGISTRANT]EXECUTIVE OFFICERS OF THE REGISTRANT \\nOur executive officers as of August 2, 2017 were as follows: \\n\\n\\tName\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\tAge\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\tPosition with the Company\\n\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\n\\tSatya\\u00a0Nadella\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t49\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\tChief Executive Officer\\n\\n\\tChristopher\\u00a0C.\\u00a0Capossela\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t47\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\tExecutive Vice President, Marketing and Consumer Business, and Chief Marketing Officer\\n\\n\\tJean-Philippe Courtois\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t56\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\tExecutive Vice President and President, Microsoft Global Sales, Marketing and Operations\\n\\n\\tKathleen T.

RISK FACTORS \\nOur operations and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties, including those described below, that could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and the trading price of our common stock. \\nWe face intense competition across all markets for our products and services, which may lead to lower revenue or operating margins. \\nCompetition in the technology sector \\nOur competitors range in size from diversified global companies with significant research and development resources to small, specialized firms whose narrower product lines may let them be more effective in deploying technical, marketing, and financial resources. Barriers to entry in many of our businesses are low and many of the areas in which we compete evolve rapidly with changing and disruptive technologies, shifting user needs, and frequent introductions of new products and services. Our ability to remain competitive depends on our success in making innovative products, devices, and services that appeal to businesses and consumers. \\nCompetition among platforms, ecosystems, and devices \\nAn important element of our business model has been to create platform-based ecosystems on which many participants can build diverse solutions. A well-established ecosystem creates beneficial network effects among users, application developers, and the platform provider that can accelerate growth. Establishing significant scale in the marketplace is necessary to achieve and maintain attractive margins. We face significant competition from firms that provide competing platforms, applications, and services. \\n\\u00b7 A competing vertically-integrated model, in which a single firm controls the software and hardware elements of a product and related services, has succeeded with some consumer products such as personal computers, tablets, phones, gaming consoles, and wearables. Competitors pursuing this model also earn revenue from services integrated with the hardware and software platform. We also offer some vertically-integrated hardware and software products and services. To the extent we shift a portion of our business to a vertically integrated model we increase our cost of revenue and reduce our operating margins. \\n\\u00b7 We derive substantial revenue from licenses of Windows operating systems on personal computers. We face significant competition from competing platforms developed for new devices and form factors such as smartphones and tablet computers. These devices compete on multiple bases including price and the perceived utility of the device and its platform. Users are increasingly turning to these devices to perform functions that in the past were performed by personal computers. Even if many users view these devices as complementary to a personal computer, the prevalence of these devices may make it more difficult to attract application developers to our PC operating system platforms. Competing with operating systems licensed at low or no cost may decrease our PC operating system margins. In addition, some of our devices compete with products made by our OEM partners, which may affect their commitment to our platform. \\n\\u00b7 Competing platforms have content and application marketplaces with scale and significant installed bases. The variety and utility of content and applications available on a platform are important to device purchasing decisions. Users sometimes incur costs to move data and buy new content and applications when switching platforms. To compete, we must successfully\\u00a0enlist developers to write applications for our marketplace and ensure that these applications have high quality, customer appeal, and value. Efforts to compete with competitors\\u2019 content and application marketplaces may increase our cost of revenue and lower our operating margins. \\nBusiness model competition \\t\\nCompanies compete with us based on a growing variety of business models. \\n\\u00b7 Even as we transition more of our business to a services and subscription business model, the license-based proprietary software model generates most of our software revenue. We bear the costs of converting original ideas into software products through investments in research and development, offsetting these costs with the revenue received from licensing our products. Many of our competitors also develop and sell software to businesses and consumers under this model. \\n\\u00b7 Other competitors develop and offer free applications, online services and content, and make money by selling third-party advertising. Advertising revenue funds development of products and services these competitors provide to users at no or little cost, competing directly with our revenue-generating products. \\n\\u00b7 Some companies compete with us using an open source business model by modifying and then distributing open source software at nominal cost to end-users, and earning revenue on advertising or complementary services and products. These firms do not bear the full costs of research and development for the software. Some open source software vendors develop software that mimics the features and functionality of our products. \\nThe competitive pressures described above may cause decreased sales volumes, price reductions, and/or increased operating costs, such as for research and development, marketing, and sales incentives. This may lead to lower revenue, gross margins, and operating income. \\nOur increasing focus on services presents execution and competitive risks.\\u00a0A growing part of our business involves cloud-based services available across the spectrum of computing devices. Our strategic vision is to compete and grow by building best-in-class platforms and productivity services for an intelligent cloud and an intelligent edge infused with AI. At the same time, our competitors are rapidly developing and deploying cloud-based services for consumers and business customers. Pricing and delivery models are evolving. Devices and form factors influence how users access services in the cloud and sometimes the user\\u2019s choice of which suite of cloud-based services to use. We are devoting significant resources to develop and deploy our cloud-based strategies. The Windows ecosystem must continue to evolve with this changing environment. We are undertaking cultural and organizational changes to drive accountability and eliminate obstacles to innovation. The Company\\u2019s investment in gaining insights from data is becoming central to the value of the services we deliver to customers, to our operational efficiency and key opportunities in monetization, customer perceptions of quality, and operational efficiency. Our ability to use data in this way may be constrained by regulatory developments that impede realizing the expected return from this investment.\\nBesides software development costs, we are incurring costs to build and maintain infrastructure to support cloud computing services. These costs will reduce the operating margins we have previously achieved. Whether we succeed in cloud-based services depends on our execution in several areas, including: \\n\\u00b7 Continuing to bring to market compelling cloud-based experiences that generate increasing traffic and market share. \\n\\u00b7 Maintaining the utility, compatibility, and performance of our cloud-based services on the growing array of computing devices, including PCs, smartphones, tablets, gaming consoles, and other television-related devices. \\n\\u00b7 Continuing to enhance the attractiveness of our cloud platforms to third-party developers. \\n\\u00b7 Ensuring our cloud-based services meet the reliability expectations of our customers and maintain the security of their data. \\n\\u00b7 Making our suite of cloud-based services platform-agnostic, available on a wide range of devices and ecosystems, including those of our competitors. \\nIt is uncertain whether our strategies will attract the users or generate the revenue required to succeed. If we are not effective in executing organizational and technical changes to increase efficiency and accelerate innovation, or if we fail to generate sufficient usage of our new products and services, we may not grow revenue in line with the infrastructure and development investments described above. This may negatively impact gross margins and operating income. \\nWe make significant investments in new products and services that may not achieve expected returns.\\u00a0We will continue to make significant investments in research, development, and marketing for existing products, services, and technologies, including the Windows operating system, the Microsoft Office system, Bing, Windows Server, the Windows Store, the Microsoft Azure Services platform, Office 365, other cloud-based offerings, and the Xbox entertainment platform. We also invest in the development and acquisition of a variety of hardware for productivity, communication, and entertainment including PCs, tablets, gaming devices, and HoloLens. Investments in new technology are speculative. Commercial success depends on many factors, including innovativeness, developer support, and effective distribution and marketing. If customers do not perceive our latest offerings as providing significant new functionality or other value, they may reduce their purchases of new software and hardware products or upgrades, unfavorably affecting revenue. We may not achieve significant revenue from new product, service, and distribution channel investments for several years, if at all. New products and services may not be profitable, and even if they are profitable, operating margins for some new products and businesses will not be as high as the margins we have experienced historically. \\nWe did extensive preparation and ongoing compatibility testing for applications and devices to help ensure a positive experience for our users installing Windows 10. However, negative upgrade experiences could adversely affect the reception of Windows\\u00a010 in the marketplace and could lead to litigation or regulatory actions by customers and government agencies.\\u00a0In addition, we anticipate that Windows\\u00a010 will enable new post-license monetization opportunities beyond initial license revenues.\\u00a0Our inability to realize these opportunities to the extent we expect could have an adverse impact on our revenues. Finally, our practices for data collection, use, and management in Windows 10 are subject to regulatory review, and may result in decisions directing us to change these practices and imposing fines. If so, we could face negative public reaction, degraded user experiences, and reduced flexibility in product design. \\nDeveloping new technologies is complex. It can require long development and testing periods. Significant delays in new releases or significant problems in creating new products or services could adversely affect our revenue. \\nAcquisitions, joint ventures, and strategic alliances may have an adverse effect on our business.\\u00a0We expect to continue making acquisitions and entering into joint ventures and strategic alliances as part of our long-term business strategy. In December 2016, we completed our acquisition of LinkedIn for $27.0 billion. The LinkedIn acquisition and other transactions and arrangements involve significant challenges and risks, including that they do not advance our business strategy, that we get an unsatisfactory return on our investment, that we have difficulty integrating and retaining new employees, business systems, and technology, or that they distract management from our other businesses. If an arrangement fails to adequately anticipate changing circumstances and interests of a party, it may result in early termination or renegotiation of the arrangement. The success of these transactions and arrangements will depend in part on our ability to leverage them to enhance our existing products and services or develop compelling new ones. It may take longer than expected to realize the full benefits from these transactions and arrangements, such as increased revenue, enhanced efficiencies, or increased market share, or the benefits may ultimately be smaller than we expected. These events could adversely affect our operating results or financial condition. \\nIf our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets become impaired, we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings.\\u00a0We acquire other companies and intangible assets and may not realize all the economic benefit from those acquisitions, which could cause an impairment of goodwill or intangibles. We review our amortizable intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. We test goodwill for impairment at least annually. Factors that may be a change in circumstances, indicating that the carrying value of our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets may not be recoverable, include a decline in our stock price and market capitalization, reduced future cash flow estimates, and slower growth rates in industry segments in which we participate. We may be required to record a significant charge on our consolidated financial statements during the period in which any impairment of our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets is determined, negatively affecting our results of operations. For example, in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2015, we recorded a $5.1 billion charge for the impairment of goodwill and a $2.2 billion charge for the impairment of intangible assets, and in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2016 we recorded a $480 million charge for the impairment of intangible assets. The impairment charges for both periods related to our phone business. Our acquisition of LinkedIn resulted in a significant increase in our goodwill and intangible asset balances. \\nWe may not earn the revenues we expect from our intellectual property rights. \\nWe may not be able to adequately protect our intellectual property rights \\nProtecting our intellectual property rights and combating unlicensed copying and use of our software and other intellectual property on a global basis is difficult. While piracy adversely affects U.S. revenue, the impact on revenue from outside the U.S. is more significant, particularly in countries where laws are less protective of intellectual property rights. Our revenue in these markets may grow slower than the underlying device market. Similarly, the absence of harmonized patent laws makes it more difficult to ensure consistent respect for patent rights. Throughout the world, we educate users about the benefits of licensing genuine products and obtaining indemnification benefits for intellectual property risks, and we educate lawmakers about the advantages of a business climate where intellectual property rights are protected. Reductions in the legal protection for software intellectual property rights could adversely affect revenue. \\nWe may not receive expected royalties from our patent licenses \\nWe expend significant resources to patent the intellectual property we create with the expectation that we will generate revenues by incorporating that intellectual property in our products or services or, in some instances, by licensing our patents to others in return for a royalty.\\u00a0Changes in the law may weaken our ability to prevent the use of patented technology or collect revenue for licensing our patents.\\u00a0These include legislative changes and regulatory actions that make it more difficult to obtain injunctions, and the increasing use of legal process to challenge issued patents. Similarly, licensees of our patents may fail to satisfy their obligations to pay us royalties, or may contest the scope and extent of their obligations. Finally, the royalties we can obtain to monetize our intellectual property may decline because of the evolution of technology, selling price changes in products using licensed patents, or the difficulty of discovering infringements.\\nThird parties may claim we infringe their intellectual property rights.\\u00a0From time to time, others claim we infringe their intellectual property rights. The number of these claims may grow because of constant technological change in the markets in which we compete, the extensive patent coverage of existing technologies, the rapid rate of issuance of new patents, and our offering of first-party devices, such as Surface and Lumia phones. To resolve these claims, we may enter into royalty and licensing agreements on terms that are less favorable than currently available, stop selling or redesign affected products or services, or pay damages to satisfy indemnification commitments with our customers. These outcomes may cause operating margins to decline. Besides money damages, in some jurisdictions plaintiffs can seek injunctive relief that may limit or prevent importing, marketing, and selling our products or services that have infringing technologies. In some countries, such as Germany, an injunction can be issued before the parties have fully litigated the validity of the underlying patents. We have paid significant amounts to settle claims related to the use of technology and intellectual property rights and to procure intellectual property rights as part of our strategy to manage this risk, and may continue to do so. \\nWe may not be able to protect our source code from copying if there is an unauthorized disclosure of source code.\\u00a0Source code, the detailed program commands for our operating systems and other software programs, is critical to our business. Although we license portions of our application and operating system source code to several licensees, we take significant measures to protect the secrecy of large portions of our source code. If a significant portion of our source code leaks, we might lose future trade secret protection for that source code. It may become easier for third parties to compete with our products by copying functionality, which could adversely affect our revenue and operating margins. Unauthorized disclosure of source code also could increase the security risks described in the next paragraph. \\nCyber-attacks and security vulnerabilities could lead to reduced revenue, increased costs, liability claims, or harm to our competitive position. \\nSecurity of Microsoft\\u2019s information technology \\nThreats to IT security can take a variety of forms. Individual and groups of hackers and sophisticated organizations, including state-sponsored organizations or nation-states, continuously undertake attacks that pose threats to our customers and our IT.\\u00a0These actors may use a wide variety of methods, which may include developing and deploying malicious software to attack our products and services and gain access to our networks and datacenters, using social engineering techniques to induce our employees, users, partners, or customers to disclose passwords or other sensitive information or take other actions to gain access to our data or our users\\u2019 or customers\\u2019 data, or acting in a coordinated manner to launch distributed denial of service or other coordinated attacks. Cyber threats are constantly evolving, increasing the difficulty of detecting and successfully defending against them. Cyber threats can have cascading impacts that unfold with increasing speed across our internal networks and systems and those of our partners and customers. Breaches of our network or data security could disrupt the security of our internal systems and business applications, impair our ability to provide services to our customers and protect the privacy of their data, result in product development delays, compromise confidential or technical business information harming our reputation or competitive position, result in theft or misuse of our intellectual property or other assets, require us to allocate more resources to improved technologies, or otherwise adversely affect our business. \\nIn addition, our internal IT environment continues to evolve. Often, we are early adopters of new devices and technologies. We embrace new ways of sharing data and communicating internally and with partners and customers using methods such as social networking and other consumer-oriented technologies. Our business policies and internal security controls may not keep pace with these changes as new threats emerge. \\nSecurity of our products, services, devices, and customers\\u2019 data \\nThe Security of our products and services is important in our customers\\u2019 decisions to purchase or use our products or services. Security threats are a challenge to companies like us whose business is technology products and services. Threats to our own IT infrastructure can also affect our customers. Customers using our cloud-based services rely on the security of our infrastructure to ensure the reliability of our services and the protection of their data. Hackers tend to focus their efforts on the most popular operating systems, programs, and services, including many of ours, and we expect that to continue. Hackers that acquire user account information at other companies can use that information to compromise our users\\u2019 accounts where accounts share the same attributes like passwords. \\nTo defend against security threats, both to our internal IT systems and those of our customers, we must continuously engineer more secure products and services, enhance security and reliability features, improve the deployment of software updates to address security vulnerabilities, develop mitigation technologies that help to secure customers from attacks even when software updates are not deployed, maintain the digital security infrastructure that protects the integrity of our network, products, and services, and provide customers security tools such as firewalls and anti-virus software. \\nThe cost of these steps could reduce our operating margins. If we fail to do these things well, actual or perceived security vulnerabilities in our products and services could harm our reputation and lead customers to reduce or delay future purchases of products or subscriptions to services, or to use competing products or services. Customers may also spend more on protecting their existing computer systems from attack, which could delay adoption of additional products or services. Customers may fail to update their systems, continue to run software or operating systems we no longer support, or may fail timely to install security patches. Any of these actions by customers could adversely affect our revenue. Actual or perceived vulnerabilities may lead to claims against us. Although our license agreements typically contain provisions that eliminate or limit our exposure to liability, there is no assurance these provisions will withstand legal challenges. Legislative or regulatory action in these areas may increase the costs to develop, implement, or secure our products and services. \\nDisclosure of personal data could result in liability and harm our reputation.\\u00a0As we continue to grow the number and scale of our cloud-based offerings, we store and process increasingly large amounts of personally identifiable information of our customers. The continued occurrence of high-profile data breaches provides evidence of an external environment increasingly hostile to information security. Despite our efforts to improve the security controls across our business groups and geographies, it is possible our security controls over personal data, our training of employees and vendors on data security, and other practices we follow may not prevent the improper disclosure of customer data we or our vendors store and manage. Improper disclosure could harm our reputation, lead to legal exposure to customers, or subject us to liability under laws that protect personal data, resulting in increased costs or loss of revenue. Our software products and services also enable our customers to store and process personal data on-premises or, increasingly, in a cloud-based environment we host. Government authorities can sometimes require us to produce customer data in response to valid legal orders. In the U.S. and elsewhere, we advocate for transparency concerning these requests and appropriate limitations on government authority to compel disclosure. Despite our efforts to protect customer data, perceptions that the collection, use, and retention of personal information is not satisfactorily protected could inhibit sales of our products or services, and could limit adoption of our cloud-based solutions by consumers, businesses, and government entities. Additional security measures we may take to address customer concerns, or constraints on our flexibility to determine where and how to operate datacenters in response to customer expectations or governmental rules or actions, may cause higher operating expenses. \\nWe may have outages, data losses, and disruptions of our online services if we fail to maintain an adequate operations infrastructure.\\u00a0Our increasing user traffic, growth in services, and the complexity of our products and services demand more computing power. We spend substantial amounts to build, purchase, or lease datacenters and equipment and to upgrade our technology and network infrastructure to handle more traffic on our websites and in our datacenters. These demands continue to increase as we introduce new products and services and support the growth of existing services such as Bing, Exchange Online, Microsoft Azure, Microsoft Account services, Office 365, OneDrive, SharePoint Online, Skype, Xbox Live, Outlook.com, and Windows Stores. We are rapidly growing our business of providing a platform and back-end hosting for services provided by third parties to their end users. Maintaining, securing, and expanding this infrastructure is expensive and complex. It requires that we maintain an Internet connectivity infrastructure that is robust and reliable within competitive and regulatory constraints that continue to evolve. Inefficiencies or operational failures, including temporary or permanent loss of customer data or insufficient Internet connectivity, could diminish the quality of our products, services, and user experience resulting in contractual liability, claims by customers and other third parties, regulatory actions, damage to our reputation, and loss of current and potential users, subscribers, and advertisers, each of which may harm our operating results and financial condition. \\nGovernment litigation and regulatory activity relating to competition rules may limit how we design and market our products.\\u00a0As a leading global software and device maker, government agencies closely scrutinize us under U.S. and foreign competition laws. An increasing number of governments are regulating competition law activities and this includes increased scrutiny in potentially large markets such as the European Union (\\u201cEU\\u201d), the U.S., and China. Some jurisdictions also allow competitors or consumers to assert claims of anti-competitive conduct. U.S. federal and state antitrust authorities have previously brought enforcement actions and continue to scrutinize our business. \\nThe European Commission (\\u201cthe Commission\\u201d) closely scrutinizes the design of high-volume Microsoft products and the terms on which we make certain technologies used in these products, such as file formats, programming interfaces, and protocols, available to other companies. Flagship product releases such as Windows 10 can receive significant scrutiny under competition laws. For example, in 2004, the Commission ordered us to create new versions of our Windows operating system that do not include certain multimedia technologies and to provide our competitors with specifications for how to implement certain proprietary Windows communications protocols in their own products. In 2009, the Commission accepted a set of commitments offered by Microsoft to address the Commission\\u2019s concerns relating to competition in web browsing software, including an undertaking to address Commission concerns relating to interoperability. The web browsing commitments expired in 2014. The remaining obligations may limit our ability to innovate in Windows or other products in the future, diminish the developer appeal of the Windows platform, and increase our product development costs. The availability of licenses related to protocols and file formats may enable competitors to develop software products that better mimic the functionality of our products, which could hamper sales of our\\u00a0products. \\nOur portfolio of first-party devices continues to grow; at the same time our OEM partners offer a large variety of devices on our platforms. As a result, increasingly we both cooperate and compete with our OEM partners, creating a risk that we fail to do so in compliance with competition rules. Regulatory scrutiny in this area may increase. Certain foreign governments, particularly in China and other countries in Asia, have advanced arguments under their competition laws that exert downward pressure on royalties for our intellectual property. Because these jurisdictions only recently implemented competition laws, their enforcement activities are unpredictable. \\nGovernment regulatory actions and court decisions such as these may hinder our ability to provide the benefits of our software to consumers and businesses, reducing the attractiveness of our products and the revenue that come from them. New competition law actions could be initiated. The outcome of such actions, or steps taken to avoid them, could adversely affect us in a variety of ways, including: \\n\\u00b7 We may have to choose between withdrawing products from certain geographies to avoid fines or designing and developing alternative versions of those products to comply with government rulings, which may entail a delay in a product release and removing functionality that customers want or on which developers rely. \\n\\u00b7 We may be required to make available licenses to our proprietary technologies on terms that do not reflect their fair market value or do not protect our associated intellectual property. \\n\\u00b7 The rulings described above may be precedent in other competition law proceedings. \\n\\u00b7 We are subject to a variety of ongoing commitments because of court or administrative orders, consent decrees, or other voluntary actions we have taken. If we fail to comply with these commitments, we may incur litigation costs and be subject to substantial fines or other remedial actions. \\n\\u00b7 Our ability to realize anticipated Windows 10 post-sale monetization opportunities may be limited. \\nOur global operations subject us to potential liability under anti-corruption, trade protection, and other laws and regulations.\\u00a0The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other anti-corruption laws and regulations (\\u201cAnti-Corruption Laws\\u201d) prohibit corrupt payments by our employees, vendors, or agents. From time to time, we receive inquiries from authorities in the U.S. and elsewhere and reports from employees and others about our business activities outside the U.S. and our compliance with Anti-Corruption Laws. Specifically, we have been cooperating with authorities in the U.S. in connection with reports concerning our compliance with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act in various countries. While we devote substantial resources to our global compliance programs and have implemented policies, training, and internal controls designed to reduce the risk of corrupt payments, our employees, vendors, or agents may violate our policies. Our failure to comply with Anti-Corruption Laws could result in significant fines and penalties, criminal sanctions against us, our officers, or our employees, prohibitions on the conduct of our business, and damage to our reputation. Operations outside the U.S. may be affected by changes in trade protection laws, policies, and measures, sanctions, and other regulatory requirements affecting trade and investment. We may be subject to legal liability and reputational damage if we sell goods or services in violation of U.S. trade sanctions on countries such as Iran, North Korea, Cuba, Sudan, and Syria. \\nOther regulatory areas that may apply to our products and online services offerings include user privacy, telecommunications, data storage and protection, and online content. For example, regulators may take the position that our offerings such as Skype are covered by laws regulating telecommunications services. Data protection authorities may assert that our collection, use, and management of customer data is inconsistent with their laws and regulations. Applying these laws and regulations to our business is often unclear, subject to change over time, and sometimes may conflict from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Additionally, these laws and governments\\u2019 approach to their enforcement, and our products and services, are continuing to evolve. Compliance with these types of regulation may involve significant costs or require changes in products or business practices that result in reduced revenue. Noncompliance could result in the imposition of penalties or orders we stop the alleged noncompliant activity. \\nLaws and regulations relating to the handling of personal data may impede the adoption of our services or result in increased costs, legal claims, or fines against us.\\u00a0The growth of our Internet- and cloud-based services internationally relies increasingly on the movement of data across national boundaries. Legal requirements relating to the collection, storage, handling, and transfer of personal data continue to evolve. For example, the EU and the U.S. formally entered into a new framework in July 2016 that provides a mechanism for companies to transfer data from EU member states to the U.S. This new framework, called the Privacy Shield, is intended to address shortcomings identified by the European Court of Justice in a predecessor mechanism. The Privacy Shield and other mechanisms are subject to review by the European courts, which may lead to uncertainty about the legal basis for data transfers across the Atlantic. In 2016, the EU adopted a new law governing data practices and privacy called the General Data Protection Regulation (\\u201cGDPR\\u201d), which becomes effective in May\\u00a02018.\\u00a0The law requires firms to meet new requirements regarding the handling of personal data. Engineering efforts to build new capabilities to facilitate compliance with the law may entail substantial expense and the diversion of engineering resources from other projects.  If we are unable to engineer products that meet Microsoft\\u2019s legal duties or help our customers meet their obligations under the GDPR or other data regulations, we might experience reduced demand for our offerings. Non-compliance with the GDPR may result in monetary penalties of up to 4% of worldwide revenue.\\nOngoing legal reviews by regulators may result in burdensome or inconsistent requirements affecting the location and movement of our customer and internal employee data as well as the management of that data. Compliance may require changes in services, business practices, or internal systems that result in increased costs, lower revenue, reduced efficiency, or greater difficulty in competing with foreign-based firms. Failure to comply with existing or new rules may result in significant penalties or orders to stop the alleged noncompliant activity. \\nOur business depends on our ability to attract and retain talented employees.\\u00a0Our business is based on successfully attracting and retaining talented employees. The market for highly skilled workers and leaders in our industry is extremely competitive. We are limited in our ability to recruit internationally by restrictive domestic immigration laws. Changes to U.S. immigration policies that restrain the flow of technical and professional talent may inhibit our ability to adequately staff our research and development efforts. If we are less successful in our recruiting efforts, or if we cannot retain key employees, our ability to develop and deliver successful products and services may be adversely affected. Effective succession planning is also important to our long-term success. Failure to ensure effective transfer of knowledge and smooth transitions involving key employees could hinder our strategic planning and execution. How employment-related laws are interpreted and applied to our workforce practices may result in increased operating costs and less flexibility in how we meet our workforce needs. \\nWe have claims and lawsuits against us that may result in adverse outcomes.\\u00a0We are subject to a variety of claims and lawsuits. These claims may arise from a wide variety of business practices and initiatives, including major new product releases such as Windows 10, significant business transactions, warranty or product claims, and employment practices. Adverse outcomes in some or all of these claims may result in significant monetary damages or injunctive relief that could adversely affect our ability to conduct our business. The litigation and other claims are subject to inherent uncertainties and management\\u2019s view of these matters may change in the future. A material adverse impact on our consolidated financial statements could occur for the period in which the effect of an unfavorable outcome becomes probable and reasonably estimable. \\nWe may have additional tax liabilities.\\u00a0We are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and many foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes. In the ordinary course of our business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. We regularly are under audit by tax authorities in different jurisdictions. Economic\\u00a0and political\\u00a0pressures to increase tax revenue in various jurisdictions may make resolving tax disputes favorably more difficult. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation in the jurisdictions where we are subject to taxation could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals. The results of an audit or litigation could have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements in the period or periods in which that determination is made. \\nWe earn a significant amount of our operating income from outside the U.S., and any repatriation of funds currently held in foreign jurisdictions to the U.S. may result in higher effective tax rates for the company. In addition, there have been proposals from Congress to change U.S. tax laws that would significantly impact how U.S. multinational corporations are taxed on foreign earnings. Although we cannot predict whether or in what form any proposed legislation may pass, if enacted, it could have a material adverse impact on our tax expense and cash flows. \\nOur hardware and software products may experience quality or supply problems.\\u00a0Our vertically-integrated hardware products such as Xbox consoles, Surface devices, and other devices we design, manufacture, and market are highly complex and can have defects in design, manufacture, or associated software. We could incur significant expenses, lost revenue, and reputational harm as a result of recalls, safety alerts, or product liability claims if we fail to prevent, detect, or address such issues through design, testing, or warranty repairs. We acquire some device components from sole suppliers. Our competitors use some of the same suppliers and their demand for hardware components can affect the capacity available to us. If a component from a sole-source supplier is delayed or becomes unavailable, whether because of supplier capacity constraint or industry shortages, we may not obtain timely replacement supplies, resulting in reduced sales. Component shortages, excess or obsolete inventory, or price reductions resulting in inventory adjustments may increase our cost of revenue. Xbox consoles, Surface devices, and other hardware are assembled in Asia and other geographies that may be subject to disruptions in the supply chain, resulting in shortages that would affect our revenue and operating margins. These same risks would apply to any other vertically-integrated hardware and software products we may offer. \\nOur software products also may experience quality or reliability problems. The highly-sophisticated software products we develop may contain bugs and other defects that interfere with their intended operation. Any defects we do not detect and fix in pre-release testing could cause reduced sales and revenue, damage to our reputation, repair or remediation costs, delays in the release of new products or versions, or legal liability. Although our license agreements typically contain provisions that eliminate or limit our exposure to liability, there is no assurance these provisions will withstand legal challenge. \\nWe strive to empower all people and organizations to achieve more, and accessibility of our products is an important aspect of this goal. There is increasing pressure from advocacy groups, regulators, competitors, and customers to make technology more accessible. If our products do not meet customer expectations or emerging global accessibility requirements, we could lose sales opportunities or face regulatory actions. \\nOur global business exposes us to operational and economic risks.\\u00a0Our customers are located in over 200 countries and a significant part of our revenue comes from international sales. The global nature of our business creates operational and economic risks. Emerging markets are a significant focus of our international growth strategy. The developing nature of these markets presents several risks, including deterioration of social, political, labor, or economic conditions in a country or region, and difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations. Although we hedge a portion of our international currency exposure, significant fluctuations in foreign exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and foreign currencies may adversely affect our revenue. Competitive or regulatory pressure to make our pricing structure uniform might require that we reduce the sales price of our software in the U.S. and other countries. \\nCatastrophic events or geopolitical conditions may disrupt our business.\\u00a0A disruption or failure of our systems or operations because of a major earthquake, weather event, cyber-attack, terrorist attack, or other catastrophic event could cause delays in completing sales, providing services, or performing other critical functions. Our corporate headquarters, a significant portion of our research and development activities, and certain other essential business operations are in the Seattle, Washington area, and we have other business operations in the Silicon Valley area of California, both of which are seismically active regions. A catastrophic event that results in the destruction or disruption of any of our critical business or IT systems could harm our ability to conduct normal business operations. Providing our customers with more services and solutions in the cloud puts a premium on the resilience of our systems and strength of our business continuity management plans, and magnifies the potential impact of prolonged service outages on our operating results. \\nAbrupt political change, terrorist activity, and armed conflict pose a risk of general economic disruption in affected countries, which may increase our operating costs. These conditions also may add uncertainty to the timing and budget for technology investment decisions by our customers, and may cause supply chain disruptions for hardware manufacturers. Geopolitical change may result in changing regulatory requirements that could impact our operating strategies, access to global markets, hiring, and profitability. Geopolitical instability may lead to sanctions and impact our ability to do business in some markets or with some public-sector customers. Emerging nationalist trends in specific countries may significantly alter the trade environment. Changes to trade policy or agreements may result in higher tariffs, local sourcing initiatives, or other developments that make it more difficult to sell our products in foreign countries. Any of these changes may negatively impact our revenues. \\nThe long-term effects of climate change on the global economy or the IT industry in particular are unclear. Environmental regulations or changes in the supply, demand or available sources of energy or other natural resources may affect the availability or cost of goods and services, including natural resources, necessary to run our business. Changes in weather where we operate may increase the costs of powering and cooling computer hardware we use to develop software and provide cloud-based services. \\nAdverse economic or market conditions may harm our business.\\u00a0Worsening economic conditions, including inflation, recession, or other changes in economic conditions, may cause lower IT spending and adversely affect our revenue. If demand for PCs, servers, and other computing devices declines, or consumer or business spending for those products declines, our revenue will be adversely affected. Substantial revenue comes from our U.S. government contracts. An extended federal government shutdown resulting from failing to pass budget appropriations, adopt continuing funding resolutions or raise the debt ceiling, and other budgetary decisions limiting or delaying federal government spending, could reduce government IT spending on our products and services and adversely affect our revenue. \\nOur product distribution system relies on an extensive partner and retail network. OEMs building devices that run our software have also been a significant means of distribution. The impact of economic conditions on our partners, such as the bankruptcy of a major distributor, OEM, or retailer, could cause sales channel disruption. \\nChallenging economic conditions also may impair the ability of our customers to pay for products and services they have purchased. As a result, allowances for doubtful accounts and write-offs of accounts receivable may increase. \\nWe maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings, types, and maturities. These investments are subject to general credit, liquidity, market, and interest rate risks, which may be exacerbated by unusual events that affect global financial markets. A significant part of our investment portfolio comprises U.S. government securities. If global credit and equity markets decline for long periods, or if there is a downgrade of the U.S. government credit rating due to an actual or threatened default on government debt, our investment portfolio may be adversely affected and we could determine that more of our investments have experienced an other-than-temporary decline in fair value, requiring impairment charges that could adversely affect our financial results. \\nChanges in our sales organization may impact revenues. In July 2017, we announced plans to reorganize our global sales organization to help enable customers\\u2019 digital transformation, add greater technical ability to our sales force, and create pooled resources that can be used across countries and industries. The reorganization is the most significant change in our global sales organization in Microsoft\\u2019s history, involving employees changing roles, adding additional talent, realigning teams, and onboarding new partners.  Successfully executing these changes will be a significant factor in enabling future revenue growth. As we navigate through this transition, sales, profitability, and cash flow could be adversely impacted.\\nPART I\\nItem 1A\\n\\n\\n[bookmark: ITEM_1B_UNRESOLVED_STAFF_COMMENTS]ITEM\\u00a01B.\\u00a0UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS \\nWe have received no written comments regarding our periodic or current reports from the staff of the SEC that were issued 180 days or more preceding the end of our fiscal year 2017 that remain unresolved. \\n[bookmark: ITEM_2_PROPERTIES]ITEM\\u00a02.

Ballmer et al, United States District Court for the Western District of Washington (\\u201cFinal Order\\u201d). For more information see http://aka.ms/MSLegalNotice2015. These annual reports will continue through 2020. During fiscal year 2017, the Antitrust Compliance Office (a) monitored the Company\\u2019s compliance with the European Commission Decision of March 24, 2004, (\\u201c2004 Decision\\u201d) and with the Company\\u2019s Public Undertaking to the European Commission dated December 16, 2009 (\\u201c2009 Undertaking\\u201d); (b) monitored, in the manner required by the Final Order, employee, customer, competitor, regulator, or other third-party complaints regarding compliance with the 2004 Decision, the 2009 Undertaking, or other EU or U.S. laws or regulations governing tying, bundling, and exclusive dealing contracts; and, (c) monitored, in the manner required by the Final Order, the training of the Company\\u2019s employees regarding the Company\\u2019s antitrust compliance polices.\\u00a0In addition, the Antitrust Compliance Officer reports to the Regulatory and Public Policy Committee of the Board at each of its regularly scheduled meetings and to the full Board annually.\\nSee Note 17 \\u2013 Contingencies of the Notes to Financial Statements (Part II, Item\\u00a08 of this Form 10-K) for information regarding legal proceedings in which we are involved. \\n[bookmark: ITEM_4_MINE_SAFETY_DISCLOSURES]ITEM\\u00a04.\\u00a0MINE SAFETY DISCLOSURES \\nNot applicable. \\u00a0\\n\\nPART I\\nItem 1B, 2, 3, 4\\n\\n\\n[bookmark: PART_II]PART II \\n[bookmark: ITEM5_MARKET_FOR_REGISTRANTS]ITEM\\u00a05.\\u00a0MARKET FOR REGISTRANT\\u2019S COMMON EQUITY, RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS, AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES \\nMARKET AND STOCKHOLDERS \\nOur common stock is traded on the NASDAQ Stock Market under the symbol MSFT.

MD&A is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, our financial statements and the accompanying Notes to Financial Statements (Part II, Item\\u00a08 of this Form 10-K). \\n[bookmark: _Hlk485373727]OVERVIEW \\nMicrosoft is a technology company whose mission is to empower every person and every organization on the planet to achieve more. We strive to create local opportunity, growth, and impact in every country around the world. Our strategy is to build best-in-class platforms and productivity services for an intelligent cloud and an intelligent edge infused with artificial intelligence (\\u201cAI\\u201d). We develop, license, and support a wide range of software products, services, and devices that deliver new opportunities, greater convenience, and enhanced value to people\\u2019s lives. Our platforms and tools help drive small business productivity, large business competitiveness, and public-sector efficiency. They also support new startups, improve educational and health outcomes, and empower human ingenuity.\\nWe generate revenue by licensing and supporting an array of software products, by offering a wide range of cloud-based and other services to consumers and businesses, by designing, manufacturing, and selling devices that integrate with our cloud-based services, and by delivering relevant online advertising to a global audience. Our most significant expenses are related to compensating employees; designing, manufacturing, marketing, and selling our products and services; datacenter costs in support of our cloud-based services; and income taxes. \\nHighlights* from fiscal year 2017 included: \\n\\u00b7 Commercial cloud annualized revenue run rate** exceeded $18.9 billion. \\n\\u00b7 Office Commercial revenue grew 6%, driven by Office 365 commercial revenue growth of 46%.\\n\\u00b7 Office Consumer revenue grew 14%, and Office 365 consumer subscribers increased to 27.0 million.  \\n\\u00b7 Microsoft Dynamics revenue grew 9%, driven by Dynamics 365 revenue growth of 78%.  \\n\\u00b7 LinkedIn contributed revenue of $2.3 billion.  \\n\\u00b7 Server products and cloud services revenue grew 13%, driven by Microsoft Azure revenue growth of 99%.   \\nEnterprise Services revenue decreased 2%, driven by a decline in revenue from custom support agreements, offset in part by higher revenue from Premier Support Services and Microsoft Consulting Services.\\n\\u00b7 Windows original equipment manufacturer licensing (\\u201cWindows OEM\\u201d) revenue increased 3%.\\n\\u00b7 Windows Commercial revenue grew 5%, driven by multi-year agreement revenue.\\n\\u00b7 Microsoft Surface revenue decreased 2%, driven by a reduction in volumes sold, offset in part by a higher mix of premium devices.\\n\\u00b7 Search advertising revenue, excluding traffic acquisition costs, grew 9%.  \\n\\u00b7 Gaming revenue decreased slightly, driven by lower Xbox hardware revenue, offset in part by growth in Xbox software and services.  \\n\\n*\\tHighlights are presented based on segment results. \\n**\\tCommercial cloud annualized revenue run rate is calculated by multiplying revenue for the last month of the quarter by twelve for Office 365 commercial, Azure, Dynamics 365, and other cloud properties. \\nOn December 8, 2016, we completed our acquisition of LinkedIn Corporation for a total purchase price of $27.0 billion. LinkedIn has been included in our consolidated results of operations since the date of acquisition. See Note 9 \\u2013 Business Combinations in the Notes to Financial Statements (Part II, Item\\u00a08 of this Form 10-K) for further discussion.\\nIn November 2016, we completed the sale of our feature phone business for $350 million.\\nIn July 2015, we announced a plan to restructure our phone business to better focus and align resources. In May 2016, we announced plans to further streamline our smartphone hardware business. Our change in phone strategy resulted in a reduction in units sold and associated expenses in fiscal year 2016 and 2017. \\nIndustry Trends \\nOur industry is dynamic and highly competitive, with frequent changes in both technologies and business models. Each industry shift is an opportunity to conceive new products, new technologies, or new ideas that can further transform the industry and our business. At Microsoft, we push the boundaries of what is possible through a broad range of research and development activities that seek to identify and address the changing demands of customers and users, industry trends, and competitive forces. \\nEconomic Conditions, Challenges, and Risks \\nThe markets for software, devices, and cloud-based services are dynamic and highly competitive. Our competitors are developing new software and devices, while also deploying competing cloud-based services for consumers and businesses. The devices and form factors customers prefer evolve rapidly, and influence how users access services in the cloud, and in some cases, the user\\u2019s choice of which suite of cloud-based services to use. We must continue to evolve and adapt over an extended time in pace with this changing environment. The investments we are making in infrastructure and devices will continue to increase our operating costs and may decrease our operating margins. \\nOur success is highly dependent on our ability to attract and retain qualified employees. We hire a mix of university and industry talent worldwide. Microsoft competes for talented individuals globally by offering an exceptional working environment, broad customer reach, scale in resources, the ability to grow one\\u2019s career across many different products and businesses, and competitive compensation and benefits. Aggregate demand for our software, services, and devices is correlated to global macroeconomic and geopolitical factors, which remain dynamic. \\n[bookmark: _Hlk479323269]Our international operations provide a significant portion of our total revenue and expenses. Many of these revenue and expenses are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. As a result, changes in foreign exchange rates may significantly affect revenue and expenses. The strengthening of the U.S. dollar relative to certain foreign currencies throughout fiscal year 2015, 2016, and 2017, negatively impacted reported revenue and reduced reported expenses from our international operations.\\nSee a discussion of these factors and other risks under Risk Factors (Part I, Item\\u00a01A of this Form 10-K). \\nSeasonality \\nOur revenue historically has fluctuated quarterly and has generally been highest in the second quarter of our fiscal year due to corporate calendar year-end spending trends in our major markets and holiday season spending by consumers.\\nReportable Segments \\nWe report our financial performance based on the following segments: Productivity and Business Processes, Intelligent Cloud, and More Personal Computing. The segment amounts included in MD&A are presented on a basis consistent with our internal management reporting.

Corporate and Other operating income (loss) is comprised of revenue deferrals related to Windows 10 and corporate-level activity not specifically allocated to a segment, including impairment, integration, and restructuring expenses.\\nFiscal year 2017 compared with fiscal year 2016 \\nRevenue decreased $64 million, due to an increase in the net revenue deferral from Windows 10. During fiscal year 2017 and 2016, we deferred net revenue from Windows 10 of $6.7 billion and $6.6 billion, respectively. \\nCorporate and Other operating loss decreased $740 million, primarily due to an $804 million reduction in impairment, integration, and restructuring expenses, driven by prior year goodwill and asset impairment charges and restructuring charges related to our phone business, offset in part by current year employee severance expenses primarily related to our sales and marketing restructuring plan.\\nFiscal year 2016 compared with fiscal year 2015 \\nCorporate and Other revenue decreased $6.6 billion, due to the net revenue deferral from Windows 10. \\nCorporate and Other operating loss decreased $2.3 billion, primarily due to an $8.9 billion reduction in impairment, integration, and restructuring expenses, driven by prior year goodwill and asset impairment charges related to our phone business, offset in part by lower revenue. \\nOPERATING EXPENSES \\nResearch and Development \\n\\u00a0\\n\\t(In millions, except percentages)\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t2017\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t2016\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t2015\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\tPercentage\\nChange\\u00a02017\\nVersus\\u00a02016\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\tPercentage\\nChange\\u00a02016\\nVersus\\u00a02015\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\n\\tResearch and development\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t$\\n\\t\\u00a0\\u00a013,037\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t$\\n\\t\\u00a0\\u00a011,988\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t$\\n\\t\\u00a0\\u00a012,046\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t9%\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t0%\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\n\\tAs a percent of revenue\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t14%\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t14%\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t13%\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t0ppt\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t1ppt\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\n\\nResearch and development expenses include payroll, employee benefits, stock-based compensation expense, and other headcount-related expenses associated with product development.

During fiscal year 2016, we recorded $630 million of asset impairment charges related to our phone business. We also recorded $480 million of restructuring charges, including employee severance expenses and contract termination costs, primarily related to our previously announced phone business restructuring plans.    \\nFiscal year 2016 compared with fiscal year 2015 \\nImpairment, integration, and restructuring expenses were $1.1 billion for fiscal year 2016, compared to $10.0 billion for fiscal year 2015. \\nDuring fiscal year 2015, we recognized impairment charges of $7.5 billion related to our phone business. Our annual goodwill impairment test as of May 1, 2015 indicated that the carrying value of our previous Phone Hardware reporting unit goodwill exceeded its estimated fair value. Accordingly, we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $5.1 billion, reducing our Phone Hardware reporting unit goodwill from $5.4 billion to $116 million, net of foreign currency remeasurements, as well as an impairment charge of $2.2 billion related to the write-down of our Phone Hardware reporting unit intangible assets. All remaining goodwill and intangible assets are included in our Devices reporting unit, within More Personal Computing under our current segment structure.

Gains and losses from changes in fair values of derivatives that are not designated as hedges are primarily recognized in other income (expense), net. Other than those derivatives entered into for investment purposes, such as commodity contracts, the gains (losses) are generally economically offset by unrealized gains (losses) in the underlying available-for-sale securities and gains (losses) on certain balance sheet amounts from foreign exchange rate changes. \\nFiscal year 2017 compared with fiscal year 2016 \\nDividends and interest income increased primarily due to higher portfolio balances and yields on fixed-income securities. Interest expense increased primarily due to higher outstanding long-term debt. Net recognized gains on investments increased primarily due to higher gains on sales of equity securities. Net losses on derivatives increased due to higher losses on equity derivatives, offset in part by lower losses on commodity and foreign currency derivatives. Other, net reflects recognized losses from certain joint ventures and divestitures. \\nFiscal year 2016 compared with fiscal year 2015 \\nDividends and interest income increased due to higher portfolio balances and slightly higher yields on fixed-income securities. Interest expense increased due to higher outstanding long-term debt. Net recognized gains on investments decreased primarily due to higher other-than-temporary impairments and lower gains on sales of fixed-income securities, offset in part by higher gains on sales of equity securities. Net losses on derivatives increased due to higher losses on currency and equity contracts and lower gains on interest rate contracts in the current period as compared to the prior period, offset in part by lower losses on commodity contracts. For fiscal year 2016, other reflects recognized losses from divestitures and certain joint ventures. \\n[bookmark: _Hlk488044971]INCOME TAXES \\nFiscal year 2017 compared with fiscal year 2016 \\nOur effective tax rate for fiscal years 2017 and 2016 was 8% and 15%, respectively.\\u00a0The decrease in our effective tax rate for fiscal year 2017 compared to fiscal year 2016 was primarily due to the realization of tax benefits attributable to previous phone business losses, offset in part by changes in the mix of our income before income taxes between the U.S. and foreign countries. The fiscal year 2016 effective tax rate included the impact of nondeductible phone charges and valuation allowances. Our effective tax rate was lower than the U.S. federal statutory rate primarily due to earnings taxed at lower rates in foreign jurisdictions resulting from producing and distributing our products and services through our foreign regional operations centers in Ireland, Singapore, and Puerto Rico. Additionally, our effective tax rate in fiscal year 2017 reflects the realization of tax benefits attributable to previous phone business losses.\\nThe mix of income before income taxes between the U.S. and foreign countries impacted our effective tax rate as a result of the geographic distribution of, and customer demand for, our products and services. We supply our Windows PC operating system to customers through our U.S. regional operating center, while we supply the Microsoft Office system and our server products and tools to customers through our foreign regional operations centers. In fiscal year 2017, our U.S. income before income taxes was $453 million and our foreign income before income taxes was $22.7 billion. Net revenue deferrals related to sales of Windows 10 negatively impacted our fiscal year 2017 U.S. income before income taxes by $6.4 billion and foreign income before income taxes by $317 million. In fiscal year 2016, our U.S. loss before income taxes was $325 million and our foreign income before income taxes was $20.1 billion. Net revenue deferrals related to sales of Windows 10 negatively impacted our fiscal year 2016 U.S. loss by $6.0 billion and foreign income before income taxes by $588 million. \\nTax contingencies and other income tax liabilities were $13.5 billion and $11.8 billion as of June 30, 2017 and 2016, respectively, and are included in other long-term liabilities. This increase relates primarily to current period intercompany transfer pricing and tax credits.\\nWhile we settled a portion of the Internal Revenue Service (\\u201cIRS\\u201d) audit for tax years 2004 to 2006 during the third quarter of fiscal year 2011, and settled a portion of the IRS audit for tax years 2007 to 2009 during the first quarter of fiscal year 2016, we remain under audit for those years. We also continue to be subject to examination by the IRS for tax years 2010 to 2016. In February 2012, the IRS withdrew its 2011 Revenue Agents Report for tax years 2004 to 2006 and reopened the audit phase of the examination. As of June 30, 2017, the primary unresolved issue relates to transfer pricing, which could have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements if not resolved favorably. We believe our allowances for income tax contingencies are adequate. We have not received a proposed assessment for the unresolved issues and do not expect a final resolution of these issues in the next 12 months.\\u00a0Based on the information currently available, we do not anticipate a significant increase or decrease to our tax contingencies for these issues within the next 12 months. \\nWe are subject to income tax in many jurisdictions outside the U.S. Our operations in certain jurisdictions remain subject to examination for tax years 1996 to 2017, some of which are currently under audit by local tax authorities. The resolutions of these audits are not expected to be material to our consolidated financial statements. \\nFiscal year 2016 compared with fiscal year 2015 \\nOur effective tax rate for fiscal years 2016 and 2015 was 15% and 34%, respectively.\\u00a0Our effective tax rate was lower than the U.S. federal statutory rate primarily due to earnings taxed at lower rates in foreign jurisdictions resulting from producing and distributing our products and services through our foreign regional operations centers in Ireland, Singapore, and Puerto Rico. \\nThe decrease in our effective tax rate for fiscal year 2016 compared to fiscal year 2015 was primarily due to changes in the mix of our income before income taxes between the U.S. and foreign countries including the impact of net revenue deferrals related to sales of Windows 10, tax benefits from the adoption of the new accounting guidance relating to stock-based compensation, and distributions from foreign affiliates. The fiscal year 2015 effective tax rate included the tax impact of losses in foreign jurisdictions for which we may not realize a tax benefit, primarily as a result of impairment and restructuring charges.\\nThe mix of income before income taxes between the U.S. and foreign countries impacted our effective tax rate as a result of the geographic distribution of, and customer demand for, our products and services. We supply our Windows PC operating system to customers through our U.S. regional operating center, while we supply the Microsoft Office system and our server products and tools to customers through our foreign regional operations centers. In fiscal year 2016, our U.S. loss before income taxes was $325 million and our foreign income before income taxes was $20.1 billion. Net revenue deferrals related to sales of Windows 10 negatively impacted our fiscal year 2016 U.S. loss before income taxes by $6.0 billion and foreign income before income taxes by $588 million. In fiscal year 2015, our U.S. income before income taxes was $7.4 billion and our foreign income before income taxes was $11.1 billion. Impairment, integration, and restructuring expense relating to our phone business decreased our fiscal year 2015 U.S income before income taxes by $1.1 billion and foreign income before income taxes by $8.9 billion. \\nFINANCIAL CONDITION \\nCash, Cash Equivalents, and Investments \\nCash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments totaled $133.0 billion as of June 30, 2017, compared with $113.2 billion as of June\\u00a030, 2016. Equity and other investments were $6.0 billion as of June 30, 2017, compared with $10.4 billion as of June\\u00a030, 2016. Our short-term investments are primarily intended to facilitate liquidity and for capital preservation. They consist predominantly of highly liquid investment-grade fixed-income securities, diversified among industries and individual issuers. The investments are predominantly U.S. dollar-denominated securities, but also include foreign currency-denominated securities to diversify risk. Our fixed-income investments are exposed to interest rate risk and credit risk. The credit risk and average maturity of our fixed-income portfolio are managed to achieve economic returns that correlate to certain fixed-income indices. The settlement risk related to these investments is insignificant given that the short-term investments held are primarily highly liquid investment-grade fixed-income securities. \\nOf the cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments as of June 30, 2017, $127.9 billion was held by our foreign subsidiaries and would be subject to material repatriation tax effects. The amount of cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments held by foreign subsidiaries subject to other restrictions on the free flow of funds (primarily currency and other local regulatory) was $2.4 billion. As of June 30, 2017, approximately 87% of the cash equivalents and short-term investments held by our foreign subsidiaries were invested in U.S. government and agency securities, approximately 3% were invested in U.S. mortgage- and asset-backed securities, and approximately 2% were invested in corporate notes and bonds of U.S. companies, all of which are denominated in U.S. dollars. The remaining cash equivalents and short-term investments held by our foreign subsidiaries were primarily invested in foreign securities.\\nSecurities lending \\nWe lend certain fixed-income and equity securities to increase investment returns. The loaned securities continue to be carried as investments on our consolidated balance sheets. Cash and/or security interests are received as collateral for the loaned securities with the amount determined based upon the underlying security lent and the creditworthiness of the borrower. Cash collateral received is recorded as an asset with a corresponding liability. Our securities lending payable balance was $97 million as of June 30, 2017. Our average and maximum securities lending payable balances for fiscal year 2017 were $484 million and $1.5 billion, respectively. Intra-year variances in the amount of securities loaned are mainly due to fluctuations in the demand for the securities. \\nValuation \\nIn general, and where applicable, we use quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities to determine the fair value of our financial instruments. This pricing methodology applies to our Level 1 investments, such as U.S. government securities, domestic and international equities, and exchange-traded mutual funds. If quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities are not available to determine fair value, then we use quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities or inputs other than the quoted prices that are observable either directly or indirectly. This pricing methodology applies to our Level 2 investments such as foreign government bonds, corporate notes and bonds, mortgage- and asset-backed securities, U.S. government and agency securities, common and preferred stock, and certificates of deposit. Level 3 investments are valued using internally developed models with unobservable inputs. Assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis using unobservable inputs are an immaterial portion of our portfolio. \\nA majority of our investments are priced by pricing vendors and are generally Level 1 or Level 2 investments as these vendors either provide a quoted market price in an active market or use observable inputs for their pricing without applying significant adjustments. Broker pricing is used mainly when a quoted price is not available, the investment is not priced by our pricing vendors, or when a broker price is more reflective of fair values in the market in which the investment trades. Our broker-priced investments are generally classified as Level 2 investments because the broker prices these investments based on similar assets without applying significant adjustments. In addition, all our broker-priced investments have a sufficient level of trading volume to demonstrate that the fair values used are appropriate for these investments. Our fair value processes include controls that are designed to ensure appropriate fair values are recorded. These controls include model validation, review of key model inputs, analysis of period-over-period fluctuations, and independent recalculation of prices where appropriate. \\nCash Flows \\nFiscal year 2017 compared with fiscal year 2016 \\nCash from operations increased $6.2 billion to $39.5 billion during the fiscal year, mainly due to an increase in cash received from customers and an income tax refund for overpayment of estimated taxes, offset in part by an increase in cash paid to employees. Cash from financing increased $16.8 billion to $8.4 billion, mainly due to a $13.2 billion increase in proceeds from issuances of debt, net of repayments, and a $4.2 billion decrease in cash used for common stock repurchases, offset in part by an $839 million increase in dividends paid. Cash used in investing increased $22.8 billion to $46.8 billion, mainly due to a $24.6 billion increase in cash used for acquisitions of companies, net of cash acquired, and purchases of intangibles and other assets, offset in part by a $1.9 billion decrease in cash used for net investment purchases, sales, and maturities.  \\nFiscal year 2016 compared with fiscal year 2015 \\nCash from operations increased $3.7 billion to $33.3 billion during the fiscal year, mainly due to lower operating expenditures and a reduction in materials and production costs, offset in part by a decrease in cash received from customers. Cash used in financing decreased $1.3 billion to $8.4 billion, mainly due to a $4.6 billion increase in proceeds from issuances of debt, net of repayments, offset in part by a $1.5 billion increase in cash used for common stock repurchases and a $1.1 billion increase in dividends paid. Cash used in investing increased $949 million to $24.0 billion, mainly due to a $2.4 billion increase in cash used for additions to property and equipment and a $1.5 billion increase in cash used for net investment purchases, sales, and maturities, offset in part by a $2.3 billion decrease in cash used for acquisitions of companies, net of cash acquired, and purchases of intangibles and other assets.  \\nDebt \\nWe issued debt to take advantage of favorable pricing and liquidity in the debt markets, reflecting our credit rating and the low interest rate environment. The proceeds of these issuances were or will be used for general corporate purposes, which may include, among other things, funding for working capital, capital expenditures, repurchases of capital stock, acquisitions, and repayment of existing debt. See Note 12 \\u2013 Debt of the Notes to Financial Statements (Part II, Item\\u00a08 of this Form 10-K) for further discussion.\\nUnearned Revenue \\nUnearned revenue as of June 30, 2017 was comprised mainly of unearned revenue from volume licensing programs. Unearned revenue from volume licensing programs represents customer billings for multi-year licensing arrangements paid for either at inception of the agreement or annually at the beginning of each coverage period and accounted for as subscriptions with revenue recognized ratably over the coverage period. Unearned revenue as of June 30, 2017 also included payments for: Windows 10 licenses; post-delivery support and consulting services to be performed in the future; Office 365 subscriptions; LinkedIn; Xbox Live subscriptions; Dynamics business solutions products; Skype prepaid credits and subscriptions; and other offerings for which we have been paid in advance and earn the revenue when we provide the service or software, or otherwise meet the revenue recognition criteria. \\nThe following table outlines the expected future recognition of unearned revenue as of June 30, 2017: \\n\\u00a0\\n\\t(In millions)\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\n\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\n\\tThree Months Ending,\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\n\\tSeptember\\u00a030, 2017\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t$\\n\\t12,544\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\n\\tDecember\\u00a031, 2017\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t9,993\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\n\\tMarch\\u00a031, 2018\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t7,307\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\n\\tJune\\u00a030, 2018\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t4,258\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\n\\tThereafter\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t10,377\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\n\\n\\tTotal\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t$\\n\\t44,479\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\n\\n\\nIf our customers choose to license cloud-based versions of our products and services rather than licensing transaction-based products and services, the associated revenue will shift from being recognized at the time of the transaction to being recognized over the subscription period or upon consumption, as applicable. \\nShare Repurchases \\nDuring fiscal year 2017, 2016, and 2015, we repurchased 170 million shares, 294 million shares, and 295 million shares of our common stock for $10.3 billion, $14.8 billion, and $13.2 billion, respectively, through our share repurchase programs. All repurchases were made using cash resources. See Note 18 \\u2013 Stockholders\\u2019 Equity of the Notes to Financial Statements (Part II, Item\\u00a08 of this Form 10-K) for further discussion.\\nDividends \\nSee Note 18 \\u2013 Stockholders\\u2019 Equity of the Notes to Financial Statements (Part II, Item\\u00a08 of this Form 10-K) for further discussion.\\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements \\nWe provide indemnifications of varying scope and size to certain customers against claims of intellectual property infringement made by third parties arising from the use of our products and certain other matters. Additionally, we have agreed to cover damages resulting from breaches of certain security and privacy commitments in our cloud business. In evaluating estimated losses on these indemnifications, we consider factors such as the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and our ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss. These obligations did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements during the periods presented. \\nContractual Obligations \\nThe following table summarizes the payments due by fiscal year for our outstanding contractual obligations as of June 30, 2017: \\n\\u00a0\\n\\t(In millions)\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t2018\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t2019-2020\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t2021-2022\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\tThereafter\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\tTotal\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\n\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\n\\tLong-term debt:\\u00a0(a)\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\n\\tPrincipal payments\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t$\\n\\t1,050\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t$\\n\\t9,518\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t$\\n\\t11,746\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t$\\n\\t55,523\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t$\\n\\t77,837\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\n\\tInterest payments\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t2,402\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t4,672\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t4,301\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t33,179\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t44,554\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\n\\tConstruction commitments\\u00a0(b)\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t1,067\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t1,067\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\n\\tOperating leases\\u00a0(b)\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t1,292\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t2,335\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t1,657\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t2,588\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t7,872\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\n\\t[bookmark: _Hlk483317742]Capital leases, including imputed interest\\u00a0(b)\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t334\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t835\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t866\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t4,612\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t6,647\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\n\\tPurchase commitments\\u00a0(c)\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t16,002\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t628\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t176\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t397\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t17,203\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\n\\tOther long-term liabilities\\u00a0(d)\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t120\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t26\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t319\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t465\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\n\\n\\tTotal contractual obligations\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t$\\n\\t22,147\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t$\\n\\t18,108\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t$\\n\\t18,772\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t$\\n\\t96,618\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t$\\n\\t155,645\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\n\\n\\n[bookmark: _Hlk485803419](a)\\tSee Note 12 \\u2013 Debt of the Notes to Financial Statements (Part II, Item\\u00a08 of this Form 10-K). \\n(b)\\tSee Note 16 \\u2013 Commitments of the Notes to Financial Statements (Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K). \\n(c)\\tAmounts represent purchase commitments, including open purchase orders and take-or-pay contracts that are not presented as construction commitments above. \\n(d)\\tWe have excluded long-term tax contingencies, other tax liabilities, deferred income taxes, and long-term pension liabilities of $14.4 billion from the amounts presented as the timing of these obligations is uncertain. We have also excluded unearned revenue and non-cash items. \\nOther Planned Uses of Capital \\nWe will continue to invest in sales, marketing, product support infrastructure, and existing and advanced areas of technology, as well as continue making acquisitions that align with our business strategy. Additions to property and equipment will continue, including new facilities, datacenters, and computer systems for research and development, sales and marketing, support, and administrative staff. We expect capital expenditures to increase in coming years to support growth in our cloud offerings. We have operating leases for most U.S. and international sales and support offices and certain equipment. We have not engaged in any related party transactions or arrangements with unconsolidated entities or other persons that are reasonably likely to materially affect liquidity or the availability of capital resources. \\nLiquidity \\nWe earn a significant amount of our operating income outside the U.S., which is deemed to be permanently reinvested in foreign jurisdictions. As a result, as discussed above under Cash, Cash Equivalents, and Investments, the majority of our cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments are held by foreign subsidiaries. We currently do not intend nor foresee a need to repatriate these funds. We expect existing domestic cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments, cash flows from operations, and access to capital markets to continue to be sufficient to fund our domestic operating activities and cash commitments for investing and financing activities, such as regular quarterly dividends, debt maturities, and material capital expenditures, for at least the next 12 months and thereafter for the foreseeable future. In addition, we expect existing foreign cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments, and cash flows from operations to continue to be sufficient to fund our foreign operating activities and cash commitments for investing activities, such as material capital expenditures, for at least the next 12 months and thereafter for the foreseeable future. \\nShould we require more capital in the U.S. than is generated by our operations domestically, for example to fund significant discretionary activities, such as business acquisitions and share repurchases, we could elect to repatriate future earnings from foreign jurisdictions or raise capital in the U.S. through debt or equity issuances. These alternatives could result in higher effective tax rates, increased interest expense, or dilution of our earnings. We have borrowed funds domestically and continue to believe we have the ability to do so at reasonable interest rates. \\nRECENT ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE \\nSee Note 1 \\u2013 Accounting Policies of the Notes to Financial Statements (Part II, Item\\u00a08 of this Form 10-K) for further discussion.\\n[bookmark: _Hlk484692557][bookmark: _Hlk484677273]APPLICATION OF CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES \\nOur consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Preparing consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses. These estimates and assumptions are affected by management\\u2019s application of accounting policies. Critical accounting policies for us include revenue recognition, impairment of investment securities, goodwill, research and development costs, contingencies, income taxes, and inventories. \\nRevenue Recognition \\nRevenue recognition for multiple-element arrangements requires judgment to determine if multiple elements exist, whether elements can be accounted for as separate units of accounting, and if so, the fair value for each of the elements. \\nJudgment is also required to assess whether future releases of certain software represent new products or upgrades and enhancements to existing products. Certain volume licensing arrangements include a perpetual license for current products combined with rights to receive unspecified future versions of software products and are accounted for as subscriptions, with billings recorded as unearned revenue and recognized as revenue ratably over the coverage period. \\nSoftware updates are evaluated on a case-by-case basis to determine whether they meet the definition of an upgrade, which may require revenue to be deferred and recognized when the upgrade is delivered. If it is determined that implied post-contract customer support (\\u201cPCS\\u201d) is being provided, revenue from the arrangement is deferred and recognized over the implied PCS term. If updates are determined to not meet the definition of an upgrade, revenue is generally recognized as products are shipped or made available. \\nMicrosoft enters into arrangements that can include various combinations of software, services, and hardware. Where elements are delivered over different periods of time, and when allowed under U.S. GAAP, revenue is allocated to the respective elements based on their relative selling prices at the inception of the arrangement, and revenue is recognized as each element is delivered. We use a hierarchy to determine the fair value to be used for allocating revenue to elements: (i)\\u00a0vendor-specific objective evidence of fair value (\\u201cVSOE\\u201d), (ii)\\u00a0third-party evidence, and (iii)\\u00a0best estimate of selling price (\\u201cESP\\u201d). For software elements, we follow the industry-specific software guidance which only allows for the use of VSOE in establishing fair value. Generally, VSOE is the price charged when the deliverable is sold separately or the price established by management for a product that is not yet sold if it is probable that the price will not change before introduction into the marketplace. ESPs are established as best estimates of what the selling prices would be if the deliverables were sold regularly on a stand-alone basis. Our process for determining ESPs requires judgment and considers multiple factors that may vary over time depending upon the unique facts and circumstances related to each deliverable. \\nCustomers purchasing a Windows 10 license will receive unspecified updates and upgrades over the life of their Windows 10 device at no additional cost. As these updates and upgrades will not be sold on a stand-alone basis, we are unable to establish VSOE. Accordingly, revenue from licenses of Windows 10 is recognized ratably over the estimated life of the related device, which ranges between two to four years. \\nThe new standard related to revenue recognition will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. See Note 1 \\u2013 Accounting Policies in the Notes to Financial Statements (Part II, Item\\u00a08 of this Form 10-K) for further discussion. \\nImpairment of Investment Securities \\nWe review investments quarterly for indicators of other-than-temporary impairment. This determination requires significant judgment. In making this judgment, we employ a systematic methodology quarterly that considers available quantitative and qualitative evidence in evaluating potential impairment of our investments. If the cost of an investment exceeds its fair value, we evaluate, among other factors, general market conditions, credit quality of debt instrument issuers, the duration and extent to which the fair value is less than cost, and for equity securities, our intent and ability to hold, or plans to sell, the investment. For fixed-income securities, we also evaluate whether we have plans to sell the security or it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery. We also consider specific adverse conditions related to the financial health of and business outlook for the investee, including industry and sector performance, changes in technology, and operational and financing cash flow factors. Once a decline in fair value is determined to be other-than-temporary, an impairment charge is recorded to other income (expense), net and a new cost basis in the investment is established. If market, industry, and/or investee conditions deteriorate, we may incur future impairments. \\n[bookmark: _Hlk478483030]Goodwill \\nWe allocate goodwill to reporting units based on the reporting unit expected to benefit from the business combination. We evaluate our reporting units on an annual basis and, if necessary, reassign goodwill using a relative fair value allocation approach. Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level (operating segment or one level below an operating segment) on an annual basis (May 1 for us) and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value. These events or circumstances could include a significant change in the business climate, legal factors, operating performance indicators, competition, or sale or disposition of a significant portion of a reporting unit. \\nApplication of the goodwill impairment test requires judgment, including the identification of reporting units, assignment of assets and liabilities to reporting units, assignment of goodwill to reporting units, and determination of the fair value of each reporting unit. The fair value of each reporting unit is estimated primarily through the use of a discounted cash flow methodology. This analysis requires significant judgments, including estimation of future cash flows, which is dependent on internal forecasts, estimation of the long-term rate of growth for our business, estimation of the useful life over which cash flows will occur, and determination of our weighted average cost of capital. \\nThe estimates used to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit change from year to year based on operating results, market conditions, and other factors. Changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value and goodwill impairment for each reporting unit. \\n[bookmark: _Hlk484694280]Research and Development Costs \\nCosts incurred internally in researching and developing a computer software product are charged to expense until technological feasibility has been established for the product. Once technological feasibility is established, all software costs are capitalized until the product is available for general release to customers. Judgment is required in determining when technological feasibility of a product is established. We have determined that technological feasibility for our software products is reached after all high-risk development issues have been resolved through coding and testing. Generally, this occurs shortly before the products are released to production. The amortization of these costs is included in cost of revenue over the estimated life of the products. \\nLegal and Other Contingencies \\nThe outcomes of legal proceedings and claims brought against us are subject to significant uncertainty. An estimated loss from a loss contingency such as a legal proceeding or claim is accrued by a charge to income if it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. In determining whether a loss should be accrued we evaluate, among other factors, the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and the ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss. Changes in these factors could materially impact our consolidated financial statements.\\n[bookmark: _Hlk484680035]Income Taxes \\nThe objectives of accounting for income taxes are to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in an entity\\u2019s financial statements or tax returns. We recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. Accounting literature also provides guidance on derecognition of income tax assets and liabilities, classification of deferred income tax assets and liabilities, accounting for interest and penalties associated with tax positions, and income tax disclosures. Judgment is required in assessing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized on our consolidated financial statements or tax returns. Variations in the actual outcome of these future tax consequences could materially impact our consolidated financial statements. \\n[bookmark: _Hlk484679102]Inventories \\nInventories are stated at average cost, subject to the lower of cost or market. Cost includes materials, labor, and manufacturing overhead related to the purchase and production of inventories. We regularly review inventory quantities on hand, future purchase commitments with our suppliers, and the estimated utility of our inventory. These reviews include analysis of demand forecasts, product life cycle status, product development plans, current sales levels, pricing strategy, and component cost trends. If our review indicates a reduction in utility below carrying value, we reduce our inventory to a new cost basis through a charge to cost of revenue. \\n\\nSTATEMENT OF MANAGEMENT\\u2019S RESPONSIBILITY FOR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS \\nManagement is responsible for the preparation of the consolidated financial statements and related information that are presented in this report. The consolidated financial statements, which include amounts based on management\\u2019s estimates and judgments, have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. \\nThe Company designs and maintains accounting and internal control systems to provide reasonable assurance at reasonable cost that assets are safeguarded against loss from unauthorized use or disposition, and that the financial records are reliable for preparing consolidated financial statements and maintaining accountability for assets. These systems are augmented by written policies, an organizational structure providing division of responsibilities, careful selection and training of qualified personnel, and a program of internal audits. \\nThe Company engaged Deloitte\\u00a0& Touche LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, to audit and render an opinion on the consolidated financial statements and internal control over financial reporting in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). \\nThe Board of Directors, through its Audit Committee, consisting solely of independent directors of the Company, meets periodically with management, internal auditors, and our independent registered public accounting firm to ensure that each is meeting its responsibilities and to discuss matters concerning internal controls and financial reporting. Deloitte\\u00a0& Touche LLP and the internal auditors each have full and free access to the Audit Committee. \\n\\n\\tSatya Nadella\\n\\n\\tChief Executive Officer\\n\\n\\t\\n\\n\\tAmy E.

A portion of these risks is hedged, but they may impact our consolidated financial statements. \\nForeign Currency \\nCertain forecasted transactions, assets, and liabilities are exposed to foreign currency risk. We monitor our foreign currency exposures daily and use hedges where practicable to offset the risks and maximize the economic effectiveness of our foreign currency positions. Principal currencies hedged include the euro, Japanese yen, British pound, Canadian dollar, and Australian dollar. \\nInterest Rate \\nOur fixed-income portfolio is diversified across credit sectors and maturities, consisting primarily of investment-grade securities. The credit risk and average maturity of the fixed-income portfolio is managed to achieve economic returns that correlate to certain global and domestic fixed-income indices. In addition, we use \\u201cTo Be Announced\\u201d forward purchase commitments of mortgage-backed assets to gain exposure to agency mortgage-backed securities. \\nEquity \\nOur equity portfolio consists of global, developed, and emerging market securities that are subject to market price risk.\\u00a0We manage the securities relative to certain global and domestic indices and expect their economic risk and return to correlate with these indices. \\nCommodity \\nWe use broad-based commodity exposures to enhance portfolio returns and facilitate portfolio diversification. Our investment portfolio has exposure to a variety of commodities, including precious metals, energy, and grain. We manage these exposures relative to global commodity indices and expect their economic risk and return to correlate with these indices. \\nVALUE-AT-RISK \\nWe use a value-at-risk (\\u201cVaR\\u201d) model to estimate and quantify our market risks. VaR is the expected loss, for a given confidence level, in the fair value of our portfolio due to adverse market movements over a defined time horizon. The VaR model is not intended to represent actual losses in fair value, including determinations of other-than-temporary losses in fair value in accordance with U.S. GAAP, but is used as a risk estimation and management tool. The distribution of the potential changes in total market value of all holdings is computed based on the historical volatilities and correlations among foreign exchange rates, interest rates, equity prices, and commodity prices, assuming normal market conditions. \\nThe VaR is calculated as the total loss that will not be exceeded at the 97.5 percentile confidence level or, alternatively stated, the losses could exceed the VaR in 25 out of 1,000 cases. Several risk factors are not captured in the model, including liquidity risk, operational risk, and legal risk. \\nThe following table sets forth the one-day VaR for substantially all of our positions as of June 30, 2017 and 2016 and for the year ended June 30, 2017: \\n\\u00a0\\n\\t(In millions)\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\n\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\tJune\\u00a030,\\n2017\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\tJune\\u00a030,\\n2016\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\tYear\\u00a0Ended June\\u00a030,\\n2017\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\n\\n\\tRisk Categories\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\tAverage\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\tHigh\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\tLow\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\n\\tForeign currency\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t$\\n\\t\\u00a0\\u00a0114\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t$\\n\\t92\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t$\\n\\t\\u00a0\\u00a0169\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t$\\n\\t\\u00a0\\u00a0303\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t$\\n\\t\\u00a0\\u00a088\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\n\\tInterest rate\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\n\\t152\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\n\\t58\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\n\\t113\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\n\\t155\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\n\\t57\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\n\\tEquity\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\n\\t54\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\n\\t\\u00a0\\u00a0157\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\n\\t121\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\n\\t165\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\n\\t54\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\n\\tCommodity\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\n\\t0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\n\\t12\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\n\\t8\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\n\\t12\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\n\\t0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\n\\n\\nTotal one-day VaR for the combined risk categories was $207 million and $225 million as of June\\u00a030, 2017 and 2016.

POLICIES \\nAccounting Principles \\nThe consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (\\u201cU.S. GAAP\\u201d). \\nWe have recast certain prior period amounts to conform to the current period presentation, with no impact on consolidated net income or cash flows. \\nPrinciples of Consolidation \\nThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Microsoft Corporation and its subsidiaries. Intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated. Equity investments through which we are able to exercise significant influence over but do not control the investee and are not the primary beneficiary of the investee\\u2019s activities are accounted for using the equity method. Investments through which we are not able to exercise significant influence over the investee and which do not have readily determinable fair values are accounted for under the cost method. \\nEstimates and Assumptions \\nPreparing financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses. Examples of estimates include: loss contingencies; product warranties; the fair value of and/or potential impairment of goodwill and intangible assets for our reporting units; product life cycles; useful lives of our tangible and intangible assets; allowances for doubtful accounts; allowances for product returns; the market value of, and demand for, our inventory; and stock-based compensation forfeiture rates. Examples of assumptions include: the elements comprising a software arrangement, including the distinction between upgrades or enhancements and new products; when technological feasibility is achieved for our products; the potential outcome of future tax consequences of events that have been recognized on our consolidated financial statements or tax returns; and determining when investment impairments are other-than-temporary. Actual results and outcomes may differ from management\\u2019s estimates and assumptions. \\n[bookmark: _Hlk484530598]Foreign Currencies \\nAssets and liabilities recorded in foreign currencies are translated at the exchange rate on the balance sheet date. Revenue and expenses are translated at average rates of exchange prevailing during the year. Translation adjustments resulting from this process are recorded to other comprehensive income (\\u201cOCI\\u201d). \\n[bookmark: _Hlk484692710]Product Revenue and Service and Other Revenue \\nProduct revenue includes sales from operating systems; cross-device productivity applications; server applications; business solution applications; desktop and server management tools; software development tools; video games; hardware such as PCs, tablets, gaming and entertainment consoles, phones, other intelligent devices, and related accessories; and training and certification of computer system integrators and developers. \\nService and other revenue includes sales from cloud-based solutions that provide customers with software, services, platforms, and content such as Microsoft Office 365, Microsoft Azure, Microsoft Dynamics 365, and Xbox Live; solution support; and consulting services. Service and other revenue also includes sales from online advertising and LinkedIn. \\n[bookmark: _Hlk484692626]Revenue Recognition \\nRevenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the fee is fixed or determinable, and collectability is probable. Revenue generally is recognized net of allowances for returns and any taxes collected from customers and subsequently remitted to governmental authorities.\\nRevenue recognition for multiple-element arrangements requires judgment to determine if multiple elements exist, whether elements can be accounted for as separate units of accounting, and if so, the fair value for each of the elements. \\nMicrosoft enters into arrangements that can include various combinations of software, services, and hardware. Where elements are delivered over different periods of time, and when allowed under U.S. GAAP, revenue is allocated to the respective elements based on their relative selling prices at the inception of the arrangement, and revenue is recognized as each element is delivered. We use a hierarchy to determine the fair value to be used for allocating revenue to elements: (i) vendor-specific objective evidence of fair value (\\u201cVSOE\\u201d), (ii) third-party evidence, and (iii) best estimate of selling price (\\u201cESP\\u201d). For software elements, we follow the industry specific software guidance which only allows for the use of VSOE in establishing fair value. Generally, VSOE is the price charged when the deliverable is sold separately or the price established by management for a product that is not yet sold if it is probable that the price will not change before introduction into the marketplace. ESPs are established as best estimates of what the selling prices would be if the deliverables were sold regularly on a stand-alone basis. Our process for determining ESPs requires judgment and considers multiple factors that may vary over time depending upon the unique facts and circumstances related to each deliverable.\\nRevenue for retail packaged products, products licensed to original equipment manufacturers (\\u201cOEMs\\u201d), and perpetual licenses under certain volume licensing programs generally is recognized as products are shipped or made available.\\nTechnology guarantee programs are accounted for as multiple-element arrangements as customers receive free or significantly discounted rights to use upcoming new versions of a software product if they license existing versions of the product during the eligibility period. Revenue is allocated between the existing product and the new product, and revenue allocated to the new product is deferred until that version is delivered. The revenue allocation is based on the VSOE of fair value of the products. The VSOE of fair value for upcoming new products are based on the price determined by management having the relevant authority when the element is not yet sold separately, but is expected to be sold in the near future at the price set by management. \\nSoftware updates that will be provided free of charge are evaluated on a case-by-case basis to determine whether they meet the definition of an upgrade and create a multiple-element arrangement, which may require revenue to be deferred and recognized when the upgrade is delivered, or if it is determined that implied post-contract customer support (\\u201cPCS\\u201d) is being provided, the arrangement is accounted for as a multiple-element arrangement and all revenue from the arrangement is deferred and recognized over the implied PCS term when the VSOE of fair value does not exist. If updates are determined to not meet the definition of an upgrade, revenue is generally recognized as products are shipped or made available. \\nCustomers purchasing a Windows 10 license will receive unspecified updates and upgrades over the life of their Windows 10 device at no additional cost. As these updates and upgrades will not be sold on a stand-alone basis, we are unable to establish VSOE of fair value. Accordingly, revenue from licenses of Windows 10 is recognized ratably over the estimated life of the related device, which ranges between two to four years.\\nCertain volume licensing arrangements include a perpetual license for current products combined with rights to receive unspecified future versions of software products, which we have determined are additional software products and are therefore accounted for as subscriptions, with billings recorded as unearned revenue and recognized as revenue ratably over the coverage period. Arrangements that include term-based licenses for current products with the right to use unspecified future versions of the software during the coverage period, are also accounted for as subscriptions, with revenue recognized ratably over the coverage period. Revenue from cloud-based services arrangements that allow for the use of a hosted software product or service over a contractually determined period of time without taking possession of software are accounted for as subscriptions with billings recorded as unearned revenue and recognized as revenue ratably over the coverage period beginning on the date the service is made available to customers. Revenue from cloud-based services arrangements that are provided on a consumption basis (for example, the amount of storage used in a particular period) is recognized commensurate with the customer utilization of such resources. \\nSome volume licensing arrangements include time-based subscriptions for cloud-based services and software offerings that are accounted for as subscriptions. These arrangements are considered multiple-element arrangements. However, because all elements are accounted for as subscriptions and have the same coverage period and delivery pattern, they have the same revenue recognition timing. \\nRevenue related to Surface devices, Xbox consoles, games published by us, phones, and other hardware components is generally recognized when ownership is transferred to the resellers or to end customers when selling directly through Microsoft retail stores and online marketplaces. A portion of revenue may be deferred when these products are combined with software elements, and/or services. Revenue related to licensing for games published by third parties for use on the Xbox consoles is recognized when games are manufactured by the game publishers. \\nDisplay advertising revenue is recognized as advertisements are displayed. Search advertising revenue is recognized when the ad appears in the search results or when the action necessary to earn the revenue has been completed. Consulting services revenue is recognized as services are rendered, generally based on the negotiated hourly rate in the consulting arrangement and the number of hours worked during the period. Consulting revenue for fixed-price services arrangements is recognized as services are provided. \\n[bookmark: _Hlk484693980]Cost of Revenue \\nCost of revenue includes: manufacturing and distribution costs for products sold and programs licensed; operating costs related to product support service centers and product distribution centers; costs incurred to include software on PCs sold by OEMs, to drive traffic to our websites, and to acquire online advertising space; costs incurred to support and maintain Internet-based products and services, including datacenter costs and royalties; warranty costs; inventory valuation adjustments; costs associated with the delivery of consulting services; and the amortization of capitalized software development costs. Capitalized software development costs are amortized over the estimated lives of the products. \\nProduct Warranty \\nWe provide for the estimated costs of fulfilling our obligations under hardware and software warranties at the time the related revenue is recognized. For hardware warranties, we estimate the costs based on historical and projected product failure rates, historical and projected repair costs, and knowledge of specific product failures (if any). The specific hardware warranty terms and conditions vary depending upon the product sold and the country in which we do business, but generally include parts and labor over a period generally ranging from 90\\u00a0days to three years. For software warranties, we estimate the costs to provide bug fixes, such as security patches, over the estimated life of the software. We regularly reevaluate our estimates to assess the adequacy of the recorded warranty liabilities and adjust the amounts as necessary. \\nResearch and Development \\nResearch and development expenses include payroll, employee benefits, stock-based compensation expense, and other headcount-related expenses associated with product development. Research and development expenses also include third-party development and programming costs, localization costs incurred to translate software for international markets, and the amortization of purchased software code and services content. Such costs related to software development are included in research and development expense until the point that technological feasibility is reached, which for our software products, is generally shortly before the products are released to production. Once technological feasibility is reached, such costs are capitalized and amortized to cost of revenue over the estimated lives of the products. \\nSales and Marketing \\nSales and marketing expenses include payroll, employee benefits, stock-based compensation expense, and other headcount-related expenses associated with sales and marketing personnel, and the costs of advertising, promotions, trade shows, seminars, and other programs. Advertising costs are expensed as incurred. Advertising expense was $1.5 billion, $1.6 billion, and $1.9 billion in fiscal years 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively. \\nStock-Based Compensation \\nCompensation cost for stock awards, which include restricted stock units (\\u201cRSUs\\u201d) and performance stock units (\\u201cPSUs\\u201d), is measured at the fair value on the grant date and recognized as expense, net of estimated forfeitures, over the related service or performance period. The fair value of stock awards is based on the quoted price of our common stock on the grant date less the present value of expected dividends not received during the vesting period. We measure the fair value of PSUs using a Monte Carlo valuation model. Compensation cost for RSUs is recognized using the straight-line method and for PSUs is recognized using the accelerated method. \\nCompensation expense for the employee stock purchase plan (\\u201cESPP\\u201d) is measured as the discount the employee is entitled to upon purchase and is recognized in the period of purchase. \\n[bookmark: _Hlk484680083]Income Taxes \\nIncome tax expense includes U.S. and international income taxes, the provision for U.S. taxes on undistributed earnings of international subsidiaries not deemed to be permanently reinvested, and interest and penalties on uncertain tax positions. Certain income and expenses are not reported in tax returns and financial statements in the same year. The tax effect of such temporary differences is reported as deferred income taxes. Deferred tax assets are reported net of a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized. All deferred income taxes are classified as long-term on our consolidated balance sheets. \\nFair Value Measurements \\n[bookmark: _Hlk484676932]We account for certain assets and liabilities at fair value. The hierarchy below lists three levels of fair value based on the extent to which inputs used in measuring fair value are observable in the market.\\u00a0We categorize each of our fair value measurements in one of these three levels based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. These levels are: \\n\\u00b7 Level 1 \\u2013 inputs are based upon unadjusted quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets. Our Level 1 non-derivative investments primarily include U.S. government securities, domestic and international equities, and actively traded mutual funds.\\u00a0Our Level 1 derivative assets and liabilities include those actively traded on exchanges. \\n\\u00b7 Level 2 \\u2013 inputs are based upon quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active, and model-based valuation techniques (e.g. the Black-Scholes model) for which all significant inputs are observable in the market or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities. Where applicable, these models project future cash flows and discount the future amounts to a present value using market-based observable inputs including interest rate curves, credit spreads, foreign exchange rates, and forward and spot prices for currencies and commodities. Our Level 2 non-derivative investments consist primarily of foreign government bonds, corporate notes and bonds, mortgage- and asset-backed securities, U.S. government and agency securities, common and preferred stock, and certificates of deposit. Our Level 2 derivative assets and liabilities primarily include certain over-the-counter option and swap contracts. \\n\\u00b7 Level 3 \\u2013 inputs are generally unobservable and typically reflect management\\u2019s estimates of assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. The fair values are therefore determined using model-based techniques, including option pricing models and discounted cash flow models. Our Level 3 non-derivative assets and liabilities primarily comprise investments in common and preferred stock, and goodwill and intangible assets, when they are recorded at fair value due to an impairment charge.\\u00a0Unobservable inputs used in the models are significant to the fair values of the assets and liabilities.\\nWe measure certain assets, including our cost and equity method investments, at fair value on a nonrecurring basis when they are deemed to be other-than-temporarily impaired. The fair values of these investments are determined based on valuation techniques using the best information available, and may include quoted market prices, market comparables, and discounted cash flow projections. An impairment charge is recorded when the cost of the investment exceeds its fair value and this condition is determined to be other-than-temporary. \\nOur other current financial assets and our current financial liabilities have fair values that approximate their carrying values. \\nFinancial Instruments \\nInvestments\\nWe consider all highly liquid interest-earning investments with a maturity of three months or less at the date of purchase to be cash equivalents. The fair values of these investments approximate their carrying values. In general, investments with original maturities of greater than three months and remaining maturities of less than one year are classified as short-term investments. Investments with maturities beyond one year may be classified as short-term based on their highly liquid nature and because such marketable securities represent the investment of cash that is available for current operations. All cash equivalents and short-term investments are classified as available-for-sale and realized gains and losses are recorded using the specific identification method. Changes in market value, excluding other-than-temporary impairments, are reflected in OCI. \\nEquity and other investments classified as long-term include both debt and equity instruments. Debt and publicly-traded equity securities are classified as available-for-sale and realized gains and losses are recorded using the specific identification method. Changes in the market value of available-for-sale securities, excluding other-than-temporary impairments, are reflected in OCI. Common and preferred stock and other investments that are restricted for more than one year or are not publicly traded are recorded at cost or using the equity method. \\nWe lend certain fixed-income and equity securities to increase investment returns. These transactions are accounted for as secured borrowings and the loaned securities continue to be carried as investments on our consolidated balance sheets. Cash and/or security interests are received as collateral for the loaned securities with the amount determined based upon the underlying security lent and the creditworthiness of the borrower. Cash received is recorded as an asset with a corresponding liability. \\nInvestments are considered to be impaired when a decline in fair value is judged to be other-than-temporary. Fair value is calculated based on publicly available market information or other estimates determined by management. We employ a systematic methodology on a quarterly basis that considers available quantitative and qualitative evidence in evaluating potential impairment of our investments. If the cost of an investment exceeds its fair value, we evaluate, among other factors, general market conditions, credit quality of debt instrument issuers, the duration and extent to which the fair value is less than cost, and for equity securities, our intent and ability to hold, or plans to sell, the investment. For fixed-income securities, we also evaluate whether we have plans to sell the security or it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery. We also consider specific adverse conditions related to the financial health of and business outlook for the investee, including industry and sector performance, changes in technology, and operational and financing cash flow factors. Once a decline in fair value is determined to be other-than-temporary, an impairment charge is recorded to other income (expense), net and a new cost basis in the investment is established. \\nDerivatives\\nDerivative instruments are recognized as either assets or liabilities and are measured at fair value. The accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and the resulting designation. \\nFor derivative instruments designated as fair value hedges, the gains (losses) are recognized in earnings in the periods of change together with the offsetting losses (gains) on the hedged items attributed to the risk being hedged. For options designated as fair value hedges, changes in the time value are excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and are recognized in earnings. \\nFor derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges, the effective portion of the gains (losses) on the derivatives is initially reported as a component of OCI and is subsequently recognized in earnings when the hedged exposure is recognized in earnings. For options designated as cash flow hedges, changes in the time value are excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and are recognized in earnings. Gains (losses) on derivatives representing either hedge components excluded from the assessment of effectiveness or hedge ineffectiveness are recognized in earnings. \\nFor derivative instruments that are not designated as hedges, gains (losses) from changes in fair values are primarily recognized in other income (expense), net. Other than those derivatives entered into for investment purposes, such as commodity contracts, the gains (losses) are generally economically offset by unrealized gains (losses) in the underlying available-for-sale securities, which are recorded as a component of OCI until the securities are sold or other-than-temporarily impaired, at which time the amounts are reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income (\\u201cAOCI\\u201d) into other income (expense), net. \\nAllowance for Doubtful Accounts \\nThe allowance for doubtful accounts reflects our best estimate of probable losses inherent in the accounts receivable balance. We determine the allowance based on known troubled accounts, historical experience, and other currently available evidence. Activity in the allowance for doubtful accounts was as follows: \\n\\u00a0\\n\\t(In millions)\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\n\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\n\\tYear Ended June\\u00a030,\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t2017\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t2016\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t2015\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\n\\tBalance, beginning of period\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t$\\n\\t426\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t$\\n\\t335\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t$\\n\\t301\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\n\\tCharged to costs and other\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t85\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t146\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t77\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\n\\tWrite-offs\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t(106\\n\\t)\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t(55\\n\\t)\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t(43\\n\\t)\\n\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\n\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\n\\tBalance, end of period\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t$\\n\\t\\u00a0\\u00a0405\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t$\\n\\t\\u00a0\\u00a0426\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t$\\n\\t\\u00a0\\u00a0335\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\n\\n\\n\\n[bookmark: _Hlk484679068]Inventories \\nInventories are stated at average cost, subject to the lower of cost or market. Cost includes materials, labor, and manufacturing overhead related to the purchase and production of inventories. We regularly review inventory quantities on hand, future purchase commitments with our suppliers, and the estimated utility of our inventory. If our review indicates a reduction in utility below carrying value, we reduce our inventory to a new cost basis through a charge to cost of revenue. \\n[bookmark: _Hlk484693415]Property and Equipment \\nProperty and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation, and depreciated using the straight-line method over the shorter of the estimated useful life of the asset or the lease term. The estimated useful lives of our property and equipment are generally as follows: computer software developed or acquired for internal use, three to seven years; computer equipment, two to three years; buildings and improvements, five to 15 years; leasehold improvements, three to 20 years; and furniture and equipment, one to 10 years. Land is not depreciated. \\n[bookmark: _Hlk484681469]Goodwill \\nGoodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level (operating segment or one level below an operating segment) on an annual basis (May 1 for us) and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value. \\n[bookmark: _Hlk484694903]Intangible Assets \\nAll of our intangible assets are subject to amortization and are amortized using the straight-line method over their estimated period of benefit, ranging from one to 15 years. We evaluate the recoverability of intangible assets periodically by taking into account events or circumstances that may warrant revised estimates of useful lives or that indicate the asset may be impaired. \\n[bookmark: _Hlk484680667][bookmark: _Hlk478628660]Recent Accounting Guidance \\n[bookmark: _Hlk476841175]Accounting for Income Taxes \\u2013 Intra-Entity Asset Transfers\\nIn October 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\\u201cFASB\\u201d) issued new guidance requiring an entity to recognize the income tax consequences of an intra-entity transfer of an asset other than inventory when the transfer occurs, rather than when the asset has been sold to an outside party. This guidance is effective for us beginning July 1, 2018, with early adoption permitted beginning July 1, 2017. We plan to adopt the guidance effective July 1, 2018. Adoption of the guidance will be applied using a modified retrospective approach through a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the effective date. A cumulative-effect adjustment will capture the write-off of income tax consequences deferred from past intra-entity transfers involving assets other than inventory and new deferred tax assets for amounts not recognized under current U.S. GAAP. We anticipate this guidance will have a material impact on our consolidated balance sheets upon adoption, and continue to evaluate any impacts to our accounting policies, processes, and systems.\\nFinancial Instruments \\u2013 Credit Losses \\n[bookmark: _Hlk478556749][bookmark: _Hlk478552693]In June 2016, the FASB issued a new standard to replace the incurred loss impairment methodology under current U.S. GAAP with a methodology that reflects expected credit losses and requires consideration of a broader range of reasonable and supportable information to inform credit loss estimates. We will be required to use a forward-looking expected credit loss model for accounts receivables, loans, and other financial instruments. Credit losses relating to available-for-sale debt securities will also be recorded through an allowance for credit losses rather than as a reduction in the amortized cost basis of the securities. The standard will be effective for us beginning July\\u00a01, 2020, with early adoption permitted beginning July\\u00a01, 2019. Adoption of the standard will be applied using a modified retrospective approach through a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the effective date. We are currently evaluating the impact of this standard on our consolidated financial statements, including accounting policies, processes, and systems.  \\nLeases \\n[bookmark: _Hlk476841969]In February 2016, the FASB issued a new standard related to leases to increase transparency and comparability among organizations by requiring the recognition of right-of-use (\\u201cROU\\u201d) assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet. Most prominent among the changes in the standard is the recognition of ROU assets and lease liabilities by lessees for those leases classified as operating leases under current U.S. GAAP. Under the standard, disclosures are required to meet the objective of enabling users of financial statements to assess the amount, timing, and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases. We will be required to recognize and measure leases existing at, or entered into after, the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented using a modified retrospective approach, with certain practical expedients available. \\nThe standard will be effective for us beginning July\\u00a01, 2019, with early adoption permitted. We elected to early adopt the standard effective July\\u00a01, 2017 concurrent with our adoption of the new standard related to revenue recognition.\\u00a0We elected the available practical expedients on adoption. In preparation for adoption of the standard, we have implemented internal controls and key system functionality to enable the preparation of financial information. \\nThe standard will have a material impact on our consolidated balance sheets, but will not have a material impact on our consolidated income statements. The most significant impact will be the recognition of ROU assets and lease liabilities for operating leases, while our accounting for capital leases remains substantially unchanged. \\nAdoption of the standard will result in the recognition of additional ROU assets and lease liabilities for operating leases of $6.6 billion and $5.2 billion as of June 30, 2017 and 2016, respectively. See Expected Impacts to Reported Results below for the impact of adoption of the standard on our consolidated financial statements.\\nFinancial Instruments \\u2013 Recognition, Measurement, Presentation, and Disclosure \\nIn January 2016, the FASB issued a new standard related to certain aspects of recognition, measurement, presentation, and disclosure of financial instruments. Most prominent among the changes in the standard is the requirement for changes in the fair value of our equity investments, with certain exceptions, to be recognized through net income rather than OCI. The standard will be effective for us beginning July\\u00a01, 2018. Adoption of the standard will be applied using a modified retrospective approach through a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the effective date. We are currently evaluating the impact of this standard on our consolidated financial statements, including accounting policies, processes, and systems.  \\n[bookmark: _Hlk478625993]Revenue from Contracts with Customers \\nIn May 2014, the FASB issued a new standard related to revenue recognition. Under the standard, revenue is recognized when a customer obtains control of promised goods or services in an amount that reflects the consideration the entity expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. In addition, the standard requires disclosure of the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers. \\nThe guidance permits two methods of adoption: retrospectively to each prior reporting period presented (full retrospective method), or retrospectively with the cumulative effect of initially applying the guidance recognized at the date of initial application (modified retrospective method). We will adopt the standard using the full retrospective method to restate each prior reporting period presented. \\n[bookmark: _Hlk481570112]The standard will be effective for us beginning July\\u00a01, 2018, with early adoption permitted. We elected to early adopt the standard effective July\\u00a01, 2017. In preparation for adoption of the standard, we have implemented internal controls and key system functionality to enable the preparation of financial information and have reached conclusions on key accounting assessments related to the standard, including our assessment that the impact of accounting for costs incurred to obtain a contract is immaterial.\\nThe most significant impact of the standard relates to our accounting for software license revenue. Specifically, for Windows 10, we will recognize revenue predominantly at the time of billing and delivery rather than ratably over the life of the related device. For certain multi-year commercial software subscriptions that include both distinct software licenses and Software Assurance, we will recognize license revenue at the time of contract execution rather than over the subscription period. Due to the complexity of certain of our commercial license subscription contracts, the actual revenue recognition treatment required under the standard will depend on contract-specific terms and in some instances may vary from recognition at the time of billing. Revenue recognition related to our hardware, cloud offerings such as Office 365, LinkedIn, and professional services will remain substantially unchanged.\\n[bookmark: _Hlk481570246][bookmark: _Hlk481570288]Adoption of the standard will result in the recognition of additional revenue of $6.6 billion and $5.8 billion for fiscal year 2017 and 2016, respectively, and an increase in the provision for income taxes of $2.5 billion and $2.1 billion, respectively, primarily due to the net change in Windows 10 revenue recognition. In addition, adoption of the standard will result in an increase in accounts receivable and other current and long-term assets of $2.7 billion and $4.2 billion, as of June 30, 2017 and 2016, respectively, driven by unbilled receivables from upfront recognition of revenue for certain multi-year commercial software subscriptions that include both distinct software licenses and Software Assurance; a reduction of unearned revenue of $17.8 billion and $11.7 billion as of June 30, 2017 and 2016, respectively, driven by the upfront recognition of license revenue from Windows 10 and certain multi-year commercial software subscriptions; and an increase in deferred income taxes of $5.2 billion and $4.8 billion as of June 30, 2017 and 2016, respectively, driven by the upfront recognition of revenue. See Expected Impacts to Reported Results below for the impact of adoption of the standard on our consolidated financial statements.\\nExpected Impacts to Reported Results \\nAdoption of the standards

Our objectives for holding derivatives include reducing, eliminating, and efficiently managing the economic impact of these exposures as effectively as possible. \\nOur derivative programs include strategies that both qualify and do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment. All notional amounts presented below are measured in U.S. dollar equivalents. \\nForeign Currency \\nCertain forecasted transactions, assets, and liabilities are exposed to foreign currency risk. We monitor our foreign currency exposures daily to maximize the economic effectiveness of our foreign currency hedge positions. Option and forward contracts are used to hedge a portion of forecasted international revenue for up to three years in the future and are designated as cash flow hedging instruments. Principal currencies hedged include the euro, Japanese yen, British pound, Canadian dollar, and Australian dollar. As of June 30, 2017 and 2016, the total notional amounts of these foreign exchange contracts sold were $8.9 billion and $8.4 billion, respectively. \\nForeign currency risks related to certain non-U.S. dollar denominated securities are hedged using foreign exchange forward contracts that are designated as fair value hedging instruments. As of June 30, 2017 and 2016, the total notional amounts of these foreign exchange contracts sold were $5.1 billion and $5.3 billion, respectively. \\nCertain options and forwards not designated as hedging instruments are also used to manage the variability in foreign exchange rates on certain balance sheet amounts and to manage other foreign currency exposures.\\u00a0As of June 30, 2017, the total notional amounts of these foreign exchange contracts purchased and sold were $8.8 billion and $10.6 billion, respectively. As of June\\u00a030, 2016, the total notional amounts of these foreign exchange contracts purchased and sold were $12.0 billion and $11.7 billion, respectively. \\nEquity \\nSecurities held in our equity and other investments portfolio are subject to market price risk.\\u00a0Market price risk is managed relative to broad-based global and domestic equity indices using certain convertible preferred investments, options, futures, and swap contracts not designated as hedging instruments. From time to time, to hedge our price risk, we may use and designate equity derivatives as hedging instruments, including puts, calls, swaps, and forwards.\\u00a0As of June 30, 2017, the total notional amounts of equity contracts purchased and sold for managing market price risk were $1.9 billion and $2.4 billion, respectively, of which $1.6 billion and $1.8 billion, respectively, were designated as hedging instruments. As of June\\u00a030, 2016, the total notional amounts of equity contracts purchased and sold for managing market price risk were $1.3 billion and $2.2 billion, respectively, of which $737 million and $986 million, respectively, were designated as hedging instruments. \\nInterest Rate \\nSecurities held in our fixed-income portfolio are subject to different interest rate risks based on their maturities. We manage the average maturity of our fixed-income portfolio to achieve economic returns that correlate to certain broad-based fixed-income indices using exchange-traded option and futures contracts, and over-the-counter swap and option contracts, none of which are designated as hedging instruments. As of June 30, 2017, the total notional amounts of fixed-interest rate contracts purchased and sold were $233 million and $352 million, respectively. As of June\\u00a030, 2016, the total notional amounts of fixed-interest rate contracts purchased and sold were $328 million and $2.4 billion, respectively. \\nIn addition, we use \\u201cTo Be Announced\\u201d forward purchase commitments of mortgage-backed assets to gain exposure to agency mortgage-backed securities.\\u00a0These meet the definition of a derivative instrument in cases where physical delivery of the assets is not taken at the earliest available delivery date. As of June 30, 2017 and 2016, the total notional derivative amounts of mortgage contracts purchased were $567 million and $548 million, respectively. \\nCredit \\nOur fixed-income portfolio is diversified and consists primarily of investment-grade securities. We use credit default swap contracts, not designated as hedging instruments, to manage credit exposures relative to broad-based indices and to facilitate portfolio diversification. We use credit default swaps as they are a low-cost method of managing exposure to individual credit risks or groups of credit risks. As of June 30, 2017, the total notional amounts of credit contracts purchased and sold were $267 million and $63 million, respectively. As of June\\u00a030, 2016, the total notional amounts of credit contracts purchased and sold were $440 million and $273 million, respectively. \\nCommodity \\nWe use broad-based commodity exposures to enhance portfolio returns and to facilitate portfolio diversification. We use swaps, futures, and option contracts, not designated as hedging instruments, to generate and manage exposures to broad-based commodity indices. We use derivatives on commodities as they can be low-cost alternatives to the purchase and storage of a variety of commodities, including, but not limited to, precious metals, energy, and grain. As of June 30, 2017, the total notional amounts of commodity contracts purchased were $19 million. As of June\\u00a030, 2016, the total notional amounts of commodity contracts purchased and sold were $631 million and $162 million, respectively. \\nCredit-Risk-Related Contingent Features \\nCertain of our counterparty agreements for derivative instruments contain provisions that require our issued and outstanding long-term unsecured debt to maintain an investment grade credit rating and require us to maintain minimum liquidity of $1.0 billion. To the extent we fail to meet these requirements, we will be required to post collateral, similar to the standard convention related to over-the-counter derivatives. As of June 30, 2017, our long-term unsecured debt rating was AAA, and cash investments were in excess of $1.0 billion. As a result, no collateral was required to be posted. \\nFair Values of Derivative Instruments \\nThe following table presents the fair values of derivative instruments designated as hedging instruments (\\u201cdesignated hedge derivatives\\u201d) and not designated as hedging instruments (\\u201cnon-designated hedge derivatives\\u201d). The fair values exclude the impact of netting derivative assets and liabilities when a legally enforceable master netting agreement exists and fair value adjustments related to our own credit risk and counterparty credit risk: \\n\\n\\t[bookmark: _Hlk482265270]\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\tJune\\u00a030, 2017\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\tJune\\u00a030,

that $130 million of net derivative gains included in AOCI as of June 30, 2017 will be reclassified into earnings within the following 12 months. No significant amounts of gains (losses) were reclassified from AOCI into earnings as a result of forecasted transactions that failed to occur during fiscal year 2017. \\nNon-Designated Derivative Gains (Losses) \\nGains (losses) from changes in fair values of derivatives that are not designated as hedges are primarily recognized in other income (expense), net. These amounts are shown in the table below, with the exception of gains (losses) on derivatives presented in income statement line items other than other income (expense), net, which were immaterial for the periods presented. Other than those derivatives entered into for investment purposes, such as commodity contracts, the gains (losses) below are generally economically offset by unrealized gains (losses) in the underlying available-for-sale securities and gains (losses) from foreign exchange rate changes on certain balance sheet amounts. \\n\\n\\t(In

Adjustments in purchase price allocations may require a change in the amounts allocated to goodwill during the periods in which the adjustments are determined. \\nAny change in the goodwill amounts resulting from foreign currency translations and purchase accounting adjustments are presented as \\u201cOther\\u201d in the above table. Also included in \\u201cOther\\u201d are business dispositions and transfers between business segments due to reorganizations, as applicable. \\nOur accumulated goodwill impairment as of both June 30, 2017 and 2016 was $11.3 billion.\\n[bookmark: _Hlk484681577]Goodwill Impairment  \\nWe test goodwill for impairment annually on May\\u00a01 at the reporting unit level, primarily using a discounted cash flow methodology with a peer-based, risk-adjusted weighted average cost of capital. We believe use of a discounted cash flow approach is the most reliable indicator of the fair values of the businesses. Effective May 1, 2017, we prospectively adopted accounting guidance that simplifies our goodwill impairment testing by eliminating the requirement to calculate the implied fair value of goodwill (formerly \\u201cStep 2\\u201d) in the event that an impairment is identified. Instead, an impairment charge is recorded based on the excess of the reporting unit\\u2019s carrying amount over its fair value.\\nNo instances of impairment were identified in our May 1, 2017 or May 1, 2016 test. During fiscal year 2015, we recorded impairment charges of $5.1 billion related to goodwill in our previous Phone Hardware reporting unit. Phone Hardware goodwill is included in the Devices reporting unit within More Personal Computing under our current segment structure. \\nUpon completion of the annual testing as of May 1, 2015, our previous Phone Hardware reporting unit goodwill was determined to be impaired. In the second half of fiscal year 2015, Phone Hardware did not meet its sales volume and revenue goals, and the mix of units sold had lower margins than planned. These results, along with changes in the competitive marketplace and an evaluation of business priorities, led to a shift in strategic direction and reduced future revenue and profitability expectations for the business. As a result of these changes in strategy and expectations, we forecasted reductions in unit volume growth rates and lower future cash flows used to estimate the fair value of the Phone Hardware reporting unit, which resulted in the determination that an impairment adjustment was required.\\nBecause our annual test indicated that Phone Hardware\\u2019s carrying value exceeded its estimated fair value, Step 2 of the goodwill impairment test was performed specific to Phone Hardware. Under Step 2, the fair value of all Phone Hardware assets and liabilities were estimated, including tangible assets, existing technology, patent agreements, and contractual arrangements, for the purpose of deriving an estimate of the implied fair value of goodwill. The implied fair value of the goodwill was then compared to the recorded goodwill to determine the amount of the impairment. Assumptions used in measuring the value of these assets and liabilities included the discount rates and royalty rates used in valuing the intangible assets, and consideration of the market environment in valuing the tangible assets.\\nNOTE 11 \\u2014 INTANGIBLE ASSETS \\nThe components of intangible assets, all of which are finite-lived, were as follows: \\n\\n\\t(In millions)\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\tGross\\nCarrying\\nAmount\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\tAccumulated\\nAmortization\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\tNet\\u00a0Carrying\\nAmount\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\tGross\\nCarrying\\nAmount\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\tAccumulated\\nAmortization\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\tNet\\u00a0Carrying\\nAmount\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\n\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\n\\tJune\\u00a030,\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t2017\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t2016\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\n\\tTechnology-based\\u00a0(a)\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t$\\n\\t7,765\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t$\\n\\t(4,318\\n\\t)\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t$\\n\\t3,447\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t$\\n\\t5,970\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t$\\n\\t(3,648\\n\\t)\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t$\\n\\t2,322\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\n\\tMarketing-related\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t4,016\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t(829\\n\\t)\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t3,187\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t1,869\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t(616\\n\\t)\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t1,253\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\n\\tContract-based\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t841\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t(722\\n\\t)\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t119\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t796\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t(718\\n\\t)\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t78\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\n\\tCustomer-related\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t4,045\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t(692\\n\\t)\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t3,353\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t465\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t(385\\n\\t)\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t80\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\n\\tTotal\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t$\\n\\t\\u00a0\\u00a016,667\\n\\t(b)\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t$\\n\\t\\u00a0\\u00a0(6,561\\n\\t)\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t$\\n\\t\\u00a0\\u00a010,106\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t$\\n\\t\\u00a0\\u00a09,100\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t$\\n\\t\\u00a0\\u00a0(5,367\\n\\t)\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t$\\n\\t\\u00a0\\u00a03,733\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\n\\n\\n\\n(a)\\tTechnology-based intangible assets included $59 million and $115 million of net carrying amount of software to be sold, leased, or otherwise marketed as of June 30, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\\n(b)\\tIncludes intangible assets related to LinkedIn and other additions.

Cash paid for interest on our debt for fiscal years 2017, 2016, and 2015 was $1.6 billion, $1.1 billion, and $620 million, respectively. Effective July 1, 2016, we retrospectively adopted accounting guidance that requires debt issuance costs to be recorded as a deduction from the carrying amount of the debt liability, consistent with debt discounts. As of June 30, 2017 and 2016, the aggregate unamortized discount and debt issuance costs associated with our long-term debt, including the current portion, were $715 million and $392 million, respectively. \\nMaturities of our long-term debt for each of the next five years and thereafter are as follows: \\n\\u00a0\\n\\t(In millions)\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\n\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\n\\tYear Ending June\\u00a030,\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\n\\t2018\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t$\\n\\t1,050\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\n\\t2019\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t4,000\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\n\\t2020\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t5,518\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\n\\t2021\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t3,750\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\n\\t2022\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t7,996\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\n\\tThereafter\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t55,523\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\n\\n\\tTotal\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t$\\n\\t\\u00a0\\u00a077,837\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\n\\n\\n\\n[bookmark: _Hlk487793170]NOTE 13 \\u2014 INCOME TAXES \\nThe components of the provision for income taxes were as follows: \\n\\u00a0\\n\\t(In millions)\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\n\\tYear Ended June\\u00a030,\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t2017\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t2016\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t2015\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\n\\tCurrent Taxes\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\n\\tU.S. federal\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t$\\n\\t2,739\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t$\\n\\t545\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t$\\n\\t3,661\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\n\\tU.S. state and local\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t30\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t136\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t364\\n\\t\\n\\n\\tForeign\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\n\\t2,472\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t1,940\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t2,065\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\n\\tCurrent taxes\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\n\\t5,241\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t2,621\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t6,090\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\n\\tDeferred Taxes\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\n\\tDeferred taxes\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t(3,296\\n\\t)\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t332\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t224\\n\\t\\n\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\n\\tProvision for income taxes\\n\\t\\n\\t$\\n\\t\\u00a0\\u00a01,945\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t$\\n\\t\\u00a0\\u00a02,953\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t$\\n\\t\\u00a0\\u00a06,314\\n\\t\\n\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\n\\n\\nIn fiscal year 2017, deferred taxes included U.S. and foreign deferred tax benefit of $2.7 billion and $617 million, respectively.\\n\\nU.S. and foreign components of income (loss) before income taxes were as follows: \\n\\u00a0\\n\\t(In millions)\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\n\\tYear Ended June\\u00a030,\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t2017\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t2016\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t2015\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\n\\tU.S.\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t$\\n\\t453\\n\\t\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t$\\n\\t(325\\n\\t)\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t$\\n\\t7,363\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\n\\tForeign \\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t22,696\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t20,076\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t11,144\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\n\\tIncome before income taxes\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t$\\n\\t\\u00a0\\u00a023,149\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t$\\n\\t\\u00a0\\u00a019,751\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t$\\n\\t\\u00a0\\u00a018,507\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\n\\n\\nIn fiscal year 2017, income before income taxes included the net impact of U.S. and foreign revenue deferrals related to the sales of Windows 10 of $6.4 billion and $317 million, respectively.

Our foreign regional operating centers, which are taxed at rates lower than the U.S. rate, generated 64%, 69%, and 73% of our foreign income before tax in fiscal years 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively. Additionally, our effective tax rate in fiscal year 2017 reflects the realization of tax benefits attributable to previous phone business losses. In general, other reconciling items consist primarily of U.S. state income taxes, permanent items, and credits. In fiscal years 2017, 2016, and 2015, there were no individually significant other reconciling items.\\nThe decrease in our effective tax rate for fiscal year 2017 compared to fiscal year 2016 was primarily due to the realization of tax benefits attributable to previous phone business losses, offset in part by changes in the mix of our income before income taxes between the U.S. and foreign countries. The fiscal year 2016 effective tax rate included the impact of nondeductible phone charges and valuation allowances.\\nThe components of the deferred income tax assets and liabilities were as follows: \\u00a0\\n\\n\\t(In millions)\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\n\\tJune\\u00a030,\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t2017\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t2016\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\n\\tDeferred Income Tax Assets\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\n\\tStock-based compensation expense\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t$\\n\\t777\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t$\\n\\t809\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\n\\tOther expense items\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t1,550\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t1,609\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\n\\tRestructuring charges\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t66\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t284\\n\\t\\n\\n\\tUnearned revenue\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t1,889\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t494\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\n\\tImpaired investments\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t59\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t226\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\n\\tLoss carryforwards\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t4,809\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t4,252\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\n\\tDepreciation and amortization\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t53\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t115\\n\\t\\n\\n\\tOther revenue items\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t130\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t89\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\n\\tDeferred income tax assets\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\n\\t9,333\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\n\\t7,878\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\n\\tLess valuation allowance\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\u00a0(3,310\\n\\t)\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\u00a0(4,729\\n\\t)\\n\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\n\\tDeferred income tax assets, net of valuation allowance\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t$\\n\\t6,023\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t$\\n\\t3,149\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\n\\tDeferred Income Tax Liabilities\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\n\\tForeign earnings\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t$\\n\\t(1,107\\n\\t)\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t$\\n\\t(1,242\\n\\t)\\n\\n\\tUnrealized gain on investments and debt\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t(1,384\\n\\t)\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t(2,102\\n\\t)\\n\\n\\tDepreciation and amortization\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t(1,630\\n\\t)\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t(1,008\\n\\t)\\n\\n\\tOther\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t(21\\n\\t)\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t(54\\n\\t)\\n\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\n\\tDeferred income tax liabilities\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\n\\t(4,142\\n\\t)\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\n\\t(4,406\\n\\t)\\n\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\n\\tNet deferred income tax assets (liabilities)\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t$\\n\\t1,881\\n\\t\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t$\\n\\t(1,257\\n\\t)\\n\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\n\\tReported As\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\n\\tOther long-term assets\\n\\t\\n\\t$\\n\\t2,412\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t$\\n\\t219\\n\\t\\n\\n\\tLong-term deferred income tax liabilities\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t(531\\n\\t)\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t(1,476\\n\\t)\\n\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\n\\tNet deferred income tax assets (liabilities)\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t$\\n\\t1,881\\n\\t\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t$\\n\\t(1,257\\n\\t)\\n\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\n\\n\\nIn fiscal year 2017, we corrected the table above to include a $2.5 billion loss carryforward and valuation allowance as of June 30, 2016. We do not consider this correction to be material, and there was no impact to our consolidated financial statements.\\nAs of June 30, 2017, we had net operating loss carryforwards of $13.7 billion, including $11.1 billion of foreign net operating loss carryforwards. The valuation allowance disclosed in the table above relates to the foreign net operating loss carryforwards and other net deferred tax assets that may not be realized. \\nDeferred income tax balances reflect the effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax bases and are stated at enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when the taxes are paid or recovered. \\nAs of June 30, 2017, we have not provided deferred U.S. income taxes or foreign withholding taxes on temporary differences of approximately $142 billion resulting from earnings for certain non-U.S. subsidiaries which are permanently reinvested outside the U.S. The unrecognized deferred tax liability associated with these temporary differences was approximately $45 billion as of June 30, 2017. \\nIncome taxes paid, net of refunds, were $2.4 billion, $3.9 billion, and $4.4 billion in fiscal years 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively. \\nTax contingencies and other income tax liabilities were $13.5 billion and $11.8 billion as of June 30, 2017 and 2016, respectively, and are included in other long-term liabilities. This increase relates primarily to current period intercompany transfer pricing and tax credits.\\nUncertain Tax Positions \\nUnrecognized tax benefits as of June 30, 2017, 2016, and 2015, were $11.7 billion, $10.2 billion, and $9.6 billion, respectively. If recognized, these tax benefits would affect our effective tax rates for fiscal years 2017, 2016, and 2015, by $10.2 billion, $8.8 billion, and $7.9 billion, respectively.\\nAs of June 30, 2017, 2016, and 2015, we had accrued interest expense related to uncertain tax positions of $2.3 billion, $1.9 billion, and $1.7 billion, respectively, net of federal income tax benefits. Interest expense on unrecognized tax benefits was $399 million, $163 million, and $237 million in fiscal years 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively, and was included in provision for income taxes.\\nThe aggregate changes in the balance of unrecognized tax benefits were as follows: \\n\\u00a0\\n\\t(In millions)\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\n\\tYear Ended June\\u00a030,\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t2017\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t2016\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t2015\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\n\\tBalance, beginning of year\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t$\\n\\t10,164\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t$\\n\\t9,599\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t$\\n\\t\\u00a0\\u00a08,714\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\n\\tDecreases related to settlements\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t(4\\n\\t)\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t(201\\n\\t)\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t(50\\n\\t)\\n\\n\\tIncreases for tax positions related to the current year\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t1,277\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t1,086\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t1,091\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\n\\tIncreases for tax positions related to prior years\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t397\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t115\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t94\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\n\\tDecreases for tax positions related to prior years\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t(49\\n\\t)\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t(317\\n\\t)\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t(144\\n\\t)\\n\\n\\tDecreases due to lapsed statutes of limitations\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t(48\\n\\t)\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t(118\\n\\t)\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t(106\\n\\t)\\n\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\n\\tBalance, end of year\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t$\\n\\t\\u00a0\\u00a011,737\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t$\\n\\t\\u00a0\\u00a010,164\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t$\\n\\t\\u00a0\\u00a09,599\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\n\\n\\n[bookmark: _Hlk487792760]While we settled a portion of the Internal Revenue Service (\\u201cIRS\\u201d) audit for tax years 2004 to 2006 during the third quarter of fiscal year 2011, and settled a portion of the IRS audit for tax years 2007 to 2009 during the first quarter of fiscal year 2016, we remain under audit for those years. We also continue to be subject to examination by the IRS for tax years 2010 to 2016. In February 2012, the IRS withdrew its 2011 Revenue Agents Report for tax years 2004 to 2006 and reopened the audit phase of the examination. As of June 30, 2017, the primary unresolved issue relates to transfer pricing, which could have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements if not resolved favorably. We believe our allowances for income tax contingencies are adequate. We have not received a proposed assessment for the unresolved issues and do not expect a final resolution of these issues in the next 12 months.\\u00a0Based on the information currently available, we do not anticipate a significant increase or decrease to our tax contingencies for these issues within the next 12 months. \\nWe are subject to income tax in many jurisdictions outside the U.S. Our operations in certain jurisdictions remain subject to examination for tax years 1996 to 2017, some of which are currently under audit by local tax authorities. The resolutions of these audits are not expected to be material to our consolidated financial statements. \\nNOTE 14 \\u2014 RESTRUCTURING CHARGES \\nPhone Hardware Restructuring \\nIn June 2015, management approved a plan to restructure our phone business to better focus and align resources (the \\u201cPhone Hardware Restructuring Plan\\u201d), under which we eliminated approximately 7,400 positions in fiscal year 2016. In fiscal year 2015, we incurred restructuring charges of $780 million under the Phone Hardware Restructuring Plan, including severance expenses and other reorganization costs. In fiscal year 2016, we reversed $21 million of previously estimated restructuring charges related to contract termination costs. The actions associated with the Phone Hardware Restructuring Plan were completed as of June\\u00a030, 2017. \\n2016 Restructuring \\nIn the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2016, management approved restructuring plans that resulted in approximately 4,700 job eliminations in fiscal year 2017, primarily across our smartphone hardware business and global sales. In fiscal year 2016, we incurred restructuring charges of $501 million in connection with the 2016 restructuring plans, including severance expenses and other reorganization costs. The actions associated with these restructuring plans were completed as of June 30, 2017.\\n2017 Restructuring \\nIn June 2017, management approved a sales and marketing restructuring plan. In fiscal year 2017, we recorded employee severance expenses of $306 million primarily related to this sales and marketing restructuring plan. We do not expect to incur additional charges for this restructuring plan in subsequent years. The actions associated with this restructuring plan are expected to be completed by the end of fiscal year 2018.\\nRestructuring Summary\\nRestructuring charges associated with each of these plans were included in impairment, integration, and restructuring expenses on our consolidated income statements, and were reflected in Corporate and Other in our table of operating income (loss) by segment. \\nChanges in the restructuring liability were as follows: \\n\\u00a0\\n\\t(In millions)\\n\\tSeverance\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\tOther \\n\\t(a)\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\tTotal\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\n\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\n\\tBalance, as of June\\u00a030, 2016\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t$\\n\\t470\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t$\\n\\t239\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t$\\n\\t709\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\n\\tRestructuring charges\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t306\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t306\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\n\\tCash paid\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\u00a0(367\\n\\t)\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\u00a0(101\\n\\t)\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\u00a0(468\\n\\t)\\n\\n\\tOther\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\u00a0(36\\n\\t)\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\u00a0(79\\n\\t)\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\u00a0(115\\n\\t)\\n\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\n\\n\\tBalance, as of June 30, 2017\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t$\\n\\t373\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t$\\n\\t59\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t$\\n\\t432\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\n\\n\\n(a)\\tPrimarily reflects activities associated with the consolidation of our facilities and manufacturing operations, including contract termination costs and asset write-downs. \\nNOTE 15 \\u2014 UNEARNED REVENUE \\nUnearned revenue by segment was as follows: \\n\\u00a0\\n\\t(In millions)\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\n\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\n\\tJune\\u00a030,\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t2017\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t2016\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\n\\tProductivity and Business Processes\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t$\\n\\t14,291\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t$\\n\\t12,497\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\n\\tIntelligent Cloud\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t13,464\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t11,472\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\n\\tMore Personal Computing\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\n\\t3,420\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\n\\t3,334\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\n\\tCorporate and Other\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t13,304\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t6,606\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\n\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\n\\tTotal\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t$\\n\\t\\u00a0\\u00a044,479\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t$\\n\\t\\u00a0\\u00a033,909\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\n\\n\\n\\nCorporate and Other consists of the net revenue deferral from Windows 10.

(\\u201cIPCom\\u201d) is a German company that holds a large portfolio of mobile technology-related patents spanning about 170 patent families and addressing a broad range of cellular technologies. IPCom has asserted 19 of these patents in litigation against Nokia Corporation (\\u201cNokia\\u201d) and many of the leading cell phone companies and operators. In November 2014, Microsoft and IPCom entered into a standstill agreement staying all of the pending litigation against Microsoft to permit the parties to pursue settlement discussions, which continue. \\nInterDigital patent litigation \\nInterDigital Technology Corporation and InterDigital Communications Corporation (collectively, \\u201cIDT\\u201d) filed four patent infringement cases against Nokia in the International Trade Commission (\\u201cITC\\u201d) and in U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware between 2007 and 2013. We were added to these cases as a defendant after we acquired the Nokia phone business. Each of the ITC matters was resolved in our favor. In September 2015, in an inter partes review the United States Patent Trial and Appeal Board issued a final written decision that deemed unpatentable all asserted claims of the patent remaining at issue in the Delaware case. IDT\\u2019s appeal of this decision was heard by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit on April 7, 2017 and the Delaware case was stayed pending final completion of the inter partes review (including appeals and any subsequent proceedings in the Patent Office). We filed an antitrust complaint against IDT in the District of Delaware in August 2015 asserting violations of Section\\u00a02 of the Sherman Act, alleging unlawful exploitation of standard essential patents. Microsoft and IDT settled these cases in May 2017 and they have been dismissed.\\nEuropean copyright levies \\nWe assumed from Nokia all potential liability due to Nokia\\u2019s alleged failure to pay \\u201cprivate copyright levies\\u201d in various European countries based upon sale of memory cards and mobile phones that incorporate blank memory.\\u00a0The levies are based upon a 2001 European Union (\\u201cEU\\u201d) Directive establishing a right for end users to make copies of copyrighted works for personal or private use, but also allowing the collection of levies based upon sales of blank media or recording devices to compensate copyright holders for private copying.\\u00a0Various collecting societies in EU countries initiated litigation against Nokia, stating it must pay levies not only based upon sales of blank memory cards, but also phones that include blank memory for data storage on the phones, regardless of actual usage of that memory.\\u00a0The most significant cases against Nokia were pending in Germany and Austria, due to both the high volume of sales and high levy amounts sought in these countries. We reached a settlement of the Austrian case in August 2016. In Germany, the only period for which settlement has not been reached is 2004 through 2007. In July 2016, the German Supreme Court heard our appeal contesting the legality of the levy assessed on phones with music players and over five megabytes of memory. The Supreme Court issued a ruling in December 2016, finding that the levy may not be appropriate for phones that have the ability to receive music files only via Bluetooth or infrared inputs, and remanded for further proceedings. A new case schedule has not been set, and we have reached a tentative settlement.  \\nOther patent and intellectual property claims \\nIn addition to the IPCom cases, there were 41 other patent infringement cases pending against Microsoft as of June 30, 2017. \\nAntitrust, Unfair Competition, and Overcharge Class Actions \\nAntitrust and unfair competition class action lawsuits were filed against us in British Columbia, Ontario, and Quebec, Canada. All three have been certified on behalf of Canadian indirect purchasers who acquired licenses for Microsoft operating system software and/or productivity application software between 1998 and 2010. \\nThe trial of the British Columbia action commenced in May 2016. The plaintiffs filed their case in chief in August 2016, setting out claims made, authorities, and evidence in support of their claims.\\u00a0A six-month oral hearing is scheduled to commence in September 2017, consisting of cross examination on witness affidavits. The Ontario and Quebec cases are inactive. \\nOther Antitrust Litigation and Claims \\nChina State Administration for Industry and Commerce investigation \\nIn 2014, Microsoft was informed that China\\u2019s State Administration for Industry and Commerce (\\u201cSAIC\\u201d) had begun a formal investigation relating to China\\u2019s Anti-Monopoly Law, and the SAIC conducted onsite inspections of Microsoft offices in Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Chengdu.\\u00a0SAIC has stated the investigation relates to compatibility, bundle sales, file verification issues related to Windows and Office software, and potentially other issues. \\nProduct-Related Litigation \\nU.S. cell phone litigation \\nNokia, along with other handset manufacturers and network operators, is a defendant in 19 lawsuits filed in the Superior Court for the District of Columbia by individual plaintiffs who allege that radio emissions from cellular handsets caused their brain tumors and other adverse health effects. We assumed responsibility for these claims as part of our acquisition of Nokia\\u2019s Devices and Services business and have been substituted for the Nokia defendants. Nine of these cases were filed in 2002 and are consolidated for certain pre-trial proceedings; the remaining 10 cases are stayed. In a separate 2009 decision, the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia held that adverse health effect claims arising from the use of cellular handsets that operate within the U.S. Federal Communications Commission radio frequency emission guidelines (\\u201cFCC Guidelines\\u201d) are pre-empted by federal law. The plaintiffs allege that their handsets either operated outside the FCC Guidelines or were manufactured before the FCC Guidelines went into effect. The lawsuits also allege an industry-wide conspiracy to manipulate the science and testing around emission guidelines. \\nIn 2013, defendants in the consolidated cases moved to exclude plaintiffs\\u2019 expert evidence of general causation on the basis of flawed scientific methodologies. In 2014, the trial court granted in part and denied in part defendants\\u2019 motion to exclude plaintiffs\\u2019 general causation experts. The defendants filed an interlocutory appeal challenging the standard for evaluating expert scientific evidence, which the District of Columbia Court of Appeals heard en banc. In October 2016, the Court of Appeals issued its decision adopting the standard advocated by defendants and remanding the cases to the trial court for further proceedings under that standard. Plaintiffs have filed a motion to reopen discovery and file additional expert evidence. \\nCanadian cell phone class action \\nNokia, along with other handset manufacturers and network operators, is a defendant in a 2013 class action lawsuit filed in the Supreme Court of British Columbia by a purported class of Canadians who have used cellular phones for at least 1,600 hours, including a subclass of users with brain tumors. Microsoft was served with the complaint in June 2014 and has been substituted for the Nokia defendants. The litigation has been dormant for more than two years. \\nOther Contingencies \\nWe also are subject to a variety of other claims and suits that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of our business. Although management currently believes that resolving claims against us, individually or in aggregate, will not have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial statements, these matters are subject to inherent uncertainties and management\\u2019s view of these matters may change in the future. \\nAs of June 30, 2017, we accrued aggregate legal liabilities of $352 million. While we intend to defend these matters vigorously, adverse outcomes that we estimate could reach approximately $1.0 billion in aggregate beyond recorded amounts are reasonably possible. Were unfavorable final outcomes to occur, there exists the possibility of a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial statements for the period in which the effects become reasonably estimable. \\nIndemnifications \\nWe provide indemnifications of varying scope and size to certain customers against claims of intellectual property infringement made by third parties arising from the use of our products and certain other matters. Additionally, we have agreed to cover damages resulting from breaches of certain security and privacy commitments in our cloud business. We evaluate estimated losses for these indemnifications, and we consider such factors as the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and the ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss. To date, we have not encountered significant costs as a result of these obligations and have not accrued any liabilities related to these indemnifications on our consolidated financial statements. \\nNOTE 18 \\u2014 STOCKHOLDERS\\u2019 EQUITY \\nShares Outstanding \\nShares of common stock outstanding were as follows: \\n\\u00a0\\n\\t(In millions)\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\n\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\n\\tYear Ended June\\u00a030,\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t2017\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t2016\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t2015\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\n\\tBalance, beginning of year\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t7,808\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t8,027\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t8,239\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\n\\tIssued\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t70\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t75\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t83\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\n\\tRepurchased\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t(170\\n\\t)\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t(294\\n\\t)\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t(295\\n\\t)\\n\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\n\\n\\tBalance, end of year\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t7,708\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t7,808\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t8,027\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\t\\n\\n\\nShare Repurchases \\nOn September\\u00a016, 2013, our Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program authorizing up to $40.0 billion in share repurchases.

Beginning January 2016, we contribute fifty cents for each dollar a participant contributes in this plan, with a maximum employer contribution of 50% of the IRS contribution limit for the calendar year. Prior to January 2016, we contributed fifty cents for each dollar of the first 6% a participant contributed in this plan, with a maximum contribution of the lesser of 3% of a participant\\u2019s earnings or 3% of the IRS compensation limit for the calendar year. Matching contributions for all plans were $734 million, $549 million, and $454 million in fiscal years 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively, and were expensed as contributed. \\n[bookmark: _Hlk485381232]NOTE 21 \\u2014 SEGMENT INFORMATION AND GEOGRAPHIC DATA \\nIn its operation of the business, management, including our chief operating decision maker, who is also our Chief Executive Officer, reviews certain financial information, including segmented internal profit and loss statements prepared on a basis not consistent with U.S. GAAP. During the periods presented, we reported our financial performance based on the following segments: Productivity and Business Processes, Intelligent Cloud, and More Personal Computing.\\nIn December 2016, we completed our acquisition of LinkedIn Corporation. LinkedIn is reported as part of our Productivity and Business Processes segment. \\nOur reportable segments are described below. \\nProductivity and Business Processes \\nOur Productivity and Business Processes segment consists of products and services in our portfolio of productivity, communication, and information services, spanning a variety of devices and platforms. This segment primarily comprises: \\n\\u2022\\tOffice Commercial, including Office 365 subscriptions and Office licensed on-premises, comprising Office, Exchange, SharePoint, Skype for Business, and Microsoft Teams, and related Client Access Licenses (\\u201cCALs\\u201d). \\n\\u2022\\tOffice Consumer, including Office 365 subscriptions and Office licensed on-premises, and Office Consumer Services, including Skype, Outlook.com, and OneDrive. \\n\\u2022\\tLinkedIn, including Talent Solutions, Marketing Solutions, and Premium Subscriptions. \\n\\u2022\\tDynamics business solutions, including Dynamics ERP on-premises, Dynamics CRM on-premises, and Dynamics 365, a set of cloud-based applications across ERP and CRM. \\nIntelligent Cloud \\nOur Intelligent Cloud segment consists of our public, private, and hybrid server products and cloud services that can power modern business. This segment primarily comprises: \\n\\u2022\\tServer products and cloud services, including Microsoft SQL Server, Windows Server, Visual Studio, System Center, and related CALs, and Azure. \\n\\u2022\\tEnterprise Services, including Premier Support Services and Microsoft Consulting Services. \\nMore Personal Computing \\nOur More Personal Computing segment consists of products and services geared towards harmonizing the interests of end users, developers, and IT professionals across all devices. This segment primarily comprises: \\n\\u2022\\tWindows, including Windows original equipment manufacturer licensing and other non-volume licensing of the Windows operating system; Windows Commercial, comprising volume licensing of the Windows operating system, Windows cloud services, and other Windows commercial offerings; patent licensing; Windows Internet of Things (\\u201cIoT\\u201d); and MSN display advertising. \\n\\u2022\\tDevices, including Microsoft Surface, PC accessories, and other intelligent devices. \\n\\u2022\\tGaming, including Xbox hardware and Xbox software and services, comprising Xbox Live transactions, subscriptions, and advertising (\\u201cXbox Live\\u201d), video games, and third-party video game royalties. \\n\\u2022\\tSearch advertising. \\nCorporate and Other includes adjustments to conform our internal accounting policies to U.S. GAAP, and impairment, integration, and restructuring expenses. Significant internal accounting policies that differ from U.S. GAAP relate to Windows 10 revenue recognition. \\nRevenue and costs are generally directly attributed to our segments. However, due to the integrated structure of our business, certain revenue recognized and costs incurred by one segment may benefit other segments. Revenue on certain contracts is allocated among the segments based on the relative value of the underlying products and services, which can include allocation based on actual prices charged, prices when sold separately, or estimated costs plus a profit margin. Cost of revenue is allocated in certain cases based on a relative revenue methodology. Operating expenses that are allocated primarily include those relating to marketing of products and services from which multiple segments benefit, and are generally allocated based on relative gross margin. \\nIn addition, certain costs incurred at a corporate level that are identifiable and that benefit our segments are allocated to them.

Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. \\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).\\u00a0Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement.\\u00a0An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.\\u00a0An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.

Internal control over financial reporting is a process to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial reporting for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Internal control over financial reporting includes maintaining records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect our transactions; providing reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary for preparation of our financial statements; providing reasonable assurance that receipts and expenditures of company assets are made in accordance with management authorization; and providing reasonable assurance that unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of company assets that could have a material effect on our financial statements would be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting is not intended to provide absolute assurance that a misstatement of our financial statements would be prevented or detected. \\nManagement conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in Internal Control \\u2013 Integrated Framework (2013)\\u00a0issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on this evaluation, management concluded that the company\\u2019s internal control over financial reporting was effective as of June 30, 2017. Deloitte\\u00a0& Touche LLP has audited our internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2017; their report is included in Item\\u00a09A. \\nThere were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended June 30, 2017 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. During fiscal year 2017, we implemented internal controls to ensure we have adequately evaluated our contracts and properly assessed the impact of the new accounting standards related to revenue recognition and leases on our financial statements to facilitate the adoption on July 1, 2017. We do not expect significant changes to our internal control over financial reporting due to the adoption of the new standards.\\n\\n\\nPART II\\nItem 9, 9A\\n\\n\\n[bookmark: REPORT_INDEPENDENT_REGISTERED_PUBLIC_ACC]REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM \\nTo the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Microsoft Corporation \\nRedmond, Washington \\nWe have audited the internal control over financial reporting of Microsoft Corporation and subsidiaries (the \\u201cCompany\\u201d) as of June 30, 2017, based on criteria established in Internal Control \\u2013 Integrated Framework (2013)\\u00a0issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.\\u00a0The Company\\u2019s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Report of Management on Internal Control over Financial Reporting.\\u00a0Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company\\u2019s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. \\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).\\u00a0Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\\u00a0Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.\\u00a0We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. \\nA company\\u2019s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the company\\u2019s principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by the company\\u2019s board of directors, management, and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.\\u00a0A company\\u2019s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1)\\u00a0pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2)\\u00a0provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3)\\u00a0provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company\\u2019s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. \\nBecause of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.\\u00a0Also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. \\nIn our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2017, based on the criteria established in Internal Control \\u2013 Integrated Framework (2013)\\u00a0issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. \\nWe have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended June 30, 2017 of the Company and our report dated August 2, 2017 expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements. \\n/s/\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0DELOITTE\\u00a0& TOUCHE LLP \\nSeattle, Washington \\nAugust 2, 2017 \\n\\nPART II\\nItem 9A\\n\\n\\n[bookmark: ITEM_9B_OR_INFORMATION]ITEM\\u00a09B.

Within the foregoing limitation, Shares underlying Awards that have been granted pursuant to the Plan but which Awards have lapsed or otherwise terminated without delivery of Shares shall become available for the grant of additional Awards.  \\n\\n3.\\tAdministration of Plan\\n\\nThe Board of Directors of the Corporation shall administer the Plan.  The Board may delegate responsibility for administration of the Plan to a Board committee (the \\\"Committee\\\") composed solely of two or more directors, each of whom is a \\\"Non-Employee Director\\\" (as that term is defined in Rule 16b-3(b) promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to its authority under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the \\u201cExchange Act\\u201d)).  The Board or the Committee, as the case may be, shall have the power to construe the Plan and the terms of the Shares, to determine all questions arising thereunder, and to adopt and amend such rules and regulations for the administration of the Plan as it may deem desirable; provided that, no consent of an Awardee is necessary where the modification, amendment, acceleration, or deferral in the reasonable judgment of the Board confers a benefit upon the Awardee, or is made pursuant to an adjustment in accordance with Section 12.  References to the \\\"Board\\\" in this Plan shall be deemed to refer to either the Board or the Committee, whichever is appropriate in the context in which the word is used.\\n\\n4.\\tDiscretionary Award Grants\\n\\nPursuant to this Plan, the Board may grant in its discretion an Award (as defined in this Section 4) to any person who is elected a director of the Corporation, and (b) is not an employee of the Corporation or any subsidiary of the Corporation.  An \\u201cAward\\u201d may be either (i) a grant of a stock option (an \\u201cOption\\u201d) or (ii) a grant of Shares or of a right to receive Shares or their cash equivalent (or both) (a \\u201cStock Award\\u201d).  No Awards under this Section 4 may be granted to any individual director with respect to more than 20,000 shares for any fiscal year of the Corporation.  No director shall have any claim or right to be granted an Award under this Plan.  Having received an Award under this Plan shall not give a director any right to receive any other Award under this Plan and the Board may determine that any or all director(s) are not eligible to receive an Award under this Plan for an indefinite period or for a specified year or years\\n\\n5.\\tAward Agreement\\n\\nEach Award granted under the Plan shall be evidenced by an Award agreement (the \\\"Agreement\\\") duly executed on behalf of the Corporation and by the director to whom such Award is granted, which Agreements may but need not be identical and which shall (a)\\u00a0comply with and be subject to the terms and conditions of the Plan and (b)\\u00a0provide that the director agrees to continue to serve as a director of the Corporation during the term for which he or she was elected.  Each Award shall vest over a period of not less than three (3) years from the date of grant, except with respect to Awards that are granted in lieu of cash compensation.  Any Agreement may contain such other terms, provisions, and conditions not inconsistent with the Plan as may be determined by the Board.  No Award shall be deemed granted within the meaning of the Plan and no purported grant of any Award shall be effective, until such Agreement shall have been duly executed on behalf of the Corporation and the director to whom the Award is to be granted.\\n\\n6.\\tStock Awards\\n\\n\\t\\t(a)  \\tStock Awards may be granted either alone, in addition to, or in tandem with other Awards granted under the Plan.  After the Board determines that it will offer a Stock Award, it will advise the director in writing or electronically, by means of an Agreement, of the terms, conditions and restrictions, including vesting, if any, related to the offer, including the number of Shares that the director shall be entitled to receive or purchase, the price to be paid, if any, and, if applicable, the time within which the director must accept the offer.  The offer shall be accepted by execution of an Agreement or as otherwise directed by the Board. \\n\\n\\t(b) \\tUnless the Board determines otherwise, the Agreement shall provide for the forfeiture of the non-vested Shares underlying such Stock Award upon the director ceasing to be a director for any reason, including death.  To the extent that the director purchased the Shares granted under such Stock Award and any such Shares remain non-vested at the time the director ceases to be a director, the cessation of director status shall cause an immediate sale of such non-vested Shares to the Company at the original price per Share paid by the director.\\n\\n7.\\tOptions \\n\\n(a)\\tThe Board shall set the exercise price for an Option granted pursuant to Section 4 of the Plan in its discretion.\\n\\n\\n\\t(b)\\tEach Option shall expire no more than ten years from the date of the granting thereof, but shall be subject to earlier termination as follows:\\n\\n\\t(i)\\tIn the event of the death of an Option holder, the Option granted to such person may be exercised to the extent exercisable on the date of death, within the earlier of (x) 180 days after the date of death of such person and (y) the date on which the Option expires by its terms, by the estate of such person, or by any person or persons who acquired the right to exercise such Option by will or by the laws of descent and distribution.  \\n\\n\\t(ii)\\tIn the event that an Option holder ceases to be a director of the Corporation, other than by reason of his or her death, an Option granted to such person may be exercised, to the extent exercisable on the date such person ceases to be a director, within the earlier of (x) 180 days after the date such person ceases to be a director and (y) the date on which the Option expires by its terms.\\n\\n8.\\tVesting and Exercise of Awards\\n\\n(a)\\tThe Board shall set the vesting schedule for Awards granted pursuant to Section 4 of the Plan in its discretion.\\n\\n(b)\\tTo the extent that the right to exercise an Option has vested and is in effect, the Option may be exercised from time to time, by giving written notice, signed by the person or persons exercising the Option, to the Corporation, stating the number of whole Shares with respect to which the Option is being exercised, accompanied by payment in full for such Shares, which payment may be in whole or in part in shares of the common stock of the Corporation already owned by the person or persons exercising the Option, valued at fair market value on the date of payment.  For purposes hereof, the fair market value of the Shares covered by an Option shall be the closing price of the Shares on the applicable date as reported in the National Market List of the National Association of Securities Dealers Inc. Automated Quotation System or on the principal national securities exchange on which the Shares are then listed for trading.\\n\\n(c)\\tUpon exercise of the Option, delivery of a certificate for fully paid and non-assessable Shares shall be made at the principal office of the Corporation in the State of Washington to the person or persons exercising the Option as soon as practicable (but in no event more than 30 days) after the date of receipt of the notice of exercise by the Corporation, or at such time, place, and manner as may be agreed upon by the Corporation and the person or persons exercising the Option.\\n\\n(d)\\tUpon a Stock Award becoming fully vested and nonforfeitable, delivery of a certificate for fully paid and non-assessable Shares shall be made at the principal office of the Corporation in the State of Washington to the person to whom the Stock Award was granted as soon as practicable (but in no event more than 30 days) after the date on which the Stock Award becomes fully vested and nonforfeitable, or at such time, place, and manner as may be agreed upon by the Corporation and the holder of the Stock Award.\\n\\n(e)\\tPrior to issuance of the Shares in connection with an Award, the director receiving the Award may request the Corporation to withhold and pay on the director\\u2019s behalf any federal, state, and local income tax obligations applicable to such Award by having the Corporation withhold Shares having a value equal to the amount requested to be withheld, and any Award under the Plan may permit that such withholding tax be paid by having the Corporation withhold Shares having a value equal to the amount requested to be withheld.  The value of the Shares to be withheld shall equal the fair market value of the Shares on the day the Award is exercised or granted, as applicable. The right of a director to dispose of Shares to the Corporation in satisfaction of withholding tax obligations shall be deemed to be approved as part of the initial grant of an Award, unless thereafter rescinded, and shall otherwise be made in compliance with Rule 16b-3 and other applicable regulations.\\n\\n9.\\tMerger, Consolidation, Sale of Assets, etc., Resulting in a Change in Control\\n\\n(a)\\tIn the event of a Change in Control (as hereinafter defined), notwithstanding the vesting provisions contained in the Agreement granting an Option or Stock Award, as applicable, to a director pursuant to this Plan, such Option shall become fully exercisable or Stock Award shall become fully vested and nonforfeitable if, within one year of such Change in Control, such director shall cease for any reason to be a member of the Board.  For purposes hereof, a Change in Control of the Corporation shall be deemed to have occurred if (i)\\u00a0there shall be consummated (x) any consolidation or merger of the Corporation in which the Corporation is not the continuing or surviving corporation or pursuant to which shares of the common stock of the Corporation would be converted into cash, securities, or other property, other than a merger of the Corporation in which the holders of the common stock of the Corporation immediately prior to the merger have the same proportionate ownership of common stock of the surviving corporation immediately after the merger, or (y)\\u00a0any sale, lease, exchange, or other transfer (in one transaction or a series of related transactions) of all, or substantially all, of the assets of the Corporation; or (ii)\\u00a0the stockholders of the Corporation approve any plan or proposal for the liquidation or dissolution of the Corporation; or (iii)\\u00a0any person (as such term is used in Sections 13(d) and 14(d)(2) of the Exchange Act), other than William H. Gates III, shall become the beneficial owner (within the meaning of Rule 13d-3 under the Exchange Act) of 30% or more of the Corporation's outstanding common stock; or (iv)\\u00a0during any period of two consecutive years, individuals who at the beginning of such period constitute the entire Board of Directors shall cease for any reason to constitute a majority thereof unless the election, or the nomination for election by the Corporation's stockholders, of each new director was approved by a vote of at least two-thirds of the directors then still in office who were directors at the beginning of the period.\\n\\n(b)\\tAny exercise of an Option permitted pursuant to this Section 9 shall be made within 180 days of the related director's termination as a director of the Corporation.\\n\\n10.\\tAwards Not Transferable\\n\\nAn Award granted pursuant to the Plan may not be sold, pledged, assigned, hypothecated, transferred, or disposed of in any manner other than by will or by the laws of descent or distribution and may be exercised, during the lifetime of the holder of an Award, only by the holder; provided that the Board may permit further transferability, on a general or specific basis, and may impose conditions and limitations on any permitted transferability. \\n\\n11.\\tNo Rights as Stockholder Until Holder\\n\\nNeither the recipient of an Award under the Plan nor his successors in interest shall have any rights as a stockholder of the Corporation with respect to any Shares subject to an Award granted to such person until such person becomes a holder of record of such Shares.\\n\\n12.\\tAdjustments Upon Changes in Capitalization or Merger\\n\\nIf any change is made to the Shares by reason of any stock split, stock dividend, recapitalization, combination of shares, exchange of shares or other change affecting the outstanding Shares as a class without the Corporation\\u2019s receipt of consideration, appropriate adjustments shall be made to (i) the maximum number and/or class of securities issuable under the Plan, (ii) the number and/or class of securities and/or the price per Share covered by outstanding Awards under the Plan, and (iii) the limits on size of awards permitted pursuant to Section 4 of the Plan.  The Board may also make adjustments described in (i)-(iii) of the previous sentence in the event of any distribution of assets to shareholders other than a normal cash dividend.  In determining adjustments to be made under this Section 12, the Board may take into account such factors as it deems appropriate, including (i) the restrictions of applicable law, (ii) the potential tax consequences of an adjustment, and (iii) the possibility that some Awardees might receive an adjustment and a distribution or other unintended benefit, and in light of such factors or circumstances may make adjustments that are not uniform or proportionate among outstanding Awards, modify vesting dates, defer the delivery of stock certificates or make other equitable adjustments.  Any such adjustments to outstanding Awards will be effected in a manner that precludes the enlargement of rights and benefits under such Awards.  Adjustments, if any, and any determinations or interpretations, including any determination of whether a distribution is other than a normal cash dividend, made by the Board shall be final, binding and conclusive.  For purposes of this Section 12, conversion of any convertible securities of the Corporation shall not be deemed to have been effected \\u201cwithout receipt of consideration.\\u201d  Except as expressly provided herein, no issuance by the Corporation of shares of stock of any class, or securities convertible into shares of stock of any class, shall affect, and no adjustment by reason thereof shall be made with respect to, the number or price of shares of common stock subject to an Award.\\n\\nIn the event of the proposed dissolution or liquidation of the Corporation, an outstanding Award (i.e., an Option that has not been exercised or a Stock Award that has not become fully vested and nonforfeitable) will terminate immediately prior to the consummation of such proposed action, unless otherwise provided by the Board.  The Board may, in the exercise of its sole discretion in such instances, declare that any Option shall terminate as of a date fixed by the Board and give each Option holder the right to exercise an Option as to all or any part of the stock covered by such Option, including Shares as to which the Option would not otherwise be exercisable.  In the event of a proposed sale of all or substantially all of the assets of the Corporation, or the merger of the Corporation with or into another corporation, each Award shall be assumed or an equivalent Award shall be substituted by such successor corporation or a parent or subsidiary of such successor corporation, unless such successor corporation does not agree to assume each and every Award or to substitute an equivalent Award, in which case the Board shall, in lieu of such assumption or substitution, provide for the immediate full vesting of any Stock Awards not yet fully vested, or provide for the Option holder to have the right to exercise such Option as to all of the stock covered by such Option, including Shares as to which such Option would not otherwise be exercisable, or both.  If the Board makes an Option fully exercisable in lieu of assumption or substitution in the event of a merger or sale of assets, the Board shall notify the Option holder that the Option shall be fully exercisable for a period of fifteen (15) days from the date of such notice, and the Option will terminate upon the expiration of such period.\\n\\n13.\\tRestrictions on Issue of Shares\\n\\nNotwithstanding anything in this Plan to the contrary, the Corporation may delay the issuance of Shares covered by any Award and the delivery of a certificate for such Shares until one of the following conditions shall be satisfied:\\n\\n(a)\\tthe Shares to be issued in connection with the grant or exercise of an Award, as applicable, are at the time of the issue of such Shares by the Corporation effectively registered under applicable federal securities laws now in force or hereafter amended; or\\n\\n(b)\\tcounsel for the Corporation shall have given an opinion, which opinion shall not be unreasonably conditioned or withheld, that such Shares are exempt from registration under applicable federal securities laws now in force or hereafter amended.\\n\\nIt is intended that all grants of Stock Awards and exercises of Options shall be effective.  Accordingly, the Corporation shall use its best efforts to bring about compliance with the above conditions within a reasonable time, except that the Corporation shall be under no obligation to cause a registration statement or a post-effective amendment to any registration statement to be prepared at its expense solely for the purpose of covering the issuance of Shares in connection with the grant or exercise of any Award.\\n\\n14.\\tPurchase for Investment\\n\\nUnless the Shares to be issued in connection with the grant or exercise of an Award granted under the Plan have been effectively registered under the Securities Act of 1933 as now in force or hereafter amended, the Corporation shall be under no obligation to issue any Shares covered by any Award unless the person or persons to whom the Shares are to be issued, in whole or in part, shall give a written representation and undertaking to the Corporation, which is satisfactory in form and scope to counsel to the Corporation and upon which, in the opinion of such counsel, the Corporation may reasonably rely, that he or she is acquiring the shares issued or transferred to him or her for his or her own account as an investment and not with a view to, or for sale in connection with, the distribution of any such Shares, and that he or she will make no transfer of the same except in compliance with any rules and regulations in force at the time of such transfer under the Securities Act of 1933, or any other applicable law, and that if Shares are issued or transferred without such registration a legend to this effect may be placed upon the certificates representing the Shares.\\n\\n15.\\tExpenses of the Plan\\n\\nAll costs and expenses of the adoption and administration of the Plan shall be borne by the Corporation and none of such expenses shall be charged to any director.\\n\\n16.\\tTermination and Amendment of Plan\\n\\nUnless sooner terminated as herein provided, the Plan shall terminate on January\\u00a01, 2019.  The Board may at any time terminate the Plan or make such modification or amendment thereof as it deems advisable; provided, however, that stockholder approval will be required for any amendment that will (a) increase the total number of shares as to which Awards may be granted under the Plan, (b) modify the class of persons eligible to receive Awards, or (c) otherwise require stockholder approval under any applicable law or regulation.   In addition, the Board shall not amend the provisions in the Plan regarding the amount, pricing, and timing for grants pursuant to this Plan more than once every six months, other than to comport with changes in the Internal Revenue Code, or the rules there under.  Except as otherwise provided in Sections 3 and 12, termination or any modification or amendment of the Plan shall not, without the consent of an Award holder, affect his or her rights under an Award previously granted to him or her.\\n\\nAll share numbers in the Plan reflect the 2-for-1 stock split effected February 2003.  The number of shares in Section 2 has also been increased to reflect the adjustments related to the special dividend payable December 2, 2004 to shareholders of record on November 17, 2004.

Since launch, we\\nhave seen meaningful increases in feed engagement, messages sent, and content interaction.\\n\\n\\u2022 With respect to careers, we spent much of the year working on fundamental building blocks\\nincluding doubling the number of jobs on LinkedIn to more than six million, improving jobs\\nrelevance, and re-launching the jobs experience on the desktop. This work resulted in a\\nsignificant increase in overall engagement with jobs throughout 2015 compared to 2014.\\n\\nFor customers, we focused on innovating the core value drivers in each product line:\\n\\n\\u2022 Within Hiring, we announced the re-launch of Recruiter, the first full refresh of our flagship\\nproduct since its original launch. The new Recruiter will rollout to customers throughout 2016\\nalongside the new Referrals product. The goal is that these products will further strengthen and\\nextend our competitive position within the talent acquisition space in the coming years.\\n\\n\\u2022 Within Marketing Solutions, Sponsored Updates increasingly evolved into the core of our\\nadvertising business, contributing approximately half of total ad revenue in 2015. Digital\\nmarketing remains a fast-evolving and competitive landscape, evidenced by the significant\\ndecline in our display ad revenue in 2015. To that end, we believe our primary focus on\\nSponsored Updates will continue to make LinkedIn the most effective platform for marketers to\\nengage professionals.\\n\\n\\u2022 We also saw early progress in two of our more nascent initiatives, Sales Solutions and\\nLearning & Development.\\n\\n\\u2022 For Sales Solutions, 2015 was the first full year we sold the flagship Sales Navigator\\nproduct through a scaled salesforce. We\\u2019ve seen early success with large, sophisticated\\ncustomers like EY, SAP, and Microsoft, and we will continue improving our core product to\\ndrive broad-based demand.\\n\\n\\u2022 In May, we acquired Lynda, signaling LinkedIn\\u2019s entry into the Learning & Development\\nmarket. This acquisition resulted from several years of evaluation in search of the right\\nasset to bring skills-based learning content to LinkedIn. Throughout 2015, we focused\\nprimarily on integrating Lynda\\u2019s high quality team and content assets, setting the foundation\\nto deliver learning content at greater scale to members and enterprise customers.\\n\\n\\n\\n19APR201622354325\\n\\nWith respect to results for the full year 2015, revenue was approximately $3.0 billion, growth of 35%\\nyear-over-year, or approximately 30% year-over-year when excluding Lynda. We delivered Adjusted\\nEBITDA1 of approximately $780 million, a 26% margin. Talent Solutions grew 41% to approximately\\n$1.9 billion, or approximately $1.8 billion and 33% growth excluding Lynda. Marketing Solutions grew\\n28% to $581 million, and Premium Subscriptions, which includes Sales Solutions, grew 22% to\\n$532 million. \\n\\nIn 2016, we plan to emphasize three key themes: a continued focus on core products; deepening the\\nvalue exchanged between members and customers; and pursuing intelligent growth through increased\\nROI discipline. We believe success across these themes will help us achieve our long-term financial\\ngoals of generating sustainable revenue and earnings growth.\\n\\nAmidst an increasingly complex global economy, our sense of purpose has never been stronger as we\\nwork to realize our vision to create economic opportunity for every member of the world\\u2019s workforce.\\n\\nSincerely,\\n\\nJeff Weiner\\nChief Executive Officer\\nLinkedIn Corporation\\n\\n1 To supplement our consolidated financial statements, which are prepared and presented in accordance with US Generally\\nAccepted Accounting Principles (\\u2018\\u2018US GAAP\\u2019\\u2019), we use certain non-GAAP financial measures, including adjusted EBITDA.\\nNet loss for 2015 was approximately $164.8 million, and net loss for 2014 was approximately $15.3 million.

Business\\n\\nOverview\\n\\nWe are the world\\u2019s largest professional network on the Internet with over 400 million members in\\nover 200 countries and territories as of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We believe we\\nare the most extensive, accurate and accessible network focused on professionals. LinkedIn\\u2019s value\\nproposition for our members and customers is simple: connect to opportunity. Members use our\\nplatform to stay connected and informed, advance their career and work smarter.\\n\\nWe provide many of our products at no cost to members with the belief that our freemium\\nbusiness model drives the most value for our members. In return, member growth and engagement\\nstrengthens the network effect that can benefit each individual LinkedIn member.\\n\\nThe critical mass of our network also enables us to create value for our customers through three\\ndistinct product lines: Talent Solutions, which includes Hiring and Learning & Development, Marketing\\nSolutions, and Premium Subscriptions. Our products are sold through two channels, an offline field\\nsales organization that engages both large and small enterprise customers; and an online channel\\nwhere enterprise customers, small business, and individual members purchase products on a self-serve\\nbasis. We seek to create reciprocal value with our products between members and customers. We\\nbelieve this builds mutually aligned incentives and marketplace dynamics supporting our long-term\\nfinancial objectives of sustainable revenue and earnings growth.\\n\\nWe were incorporated in Delaware in March 2003 under the name LinkedIn, Ltd. and changed our\\nname to LinkedIn Corporation in January 2005. Our principal executive offices are located at\\n2029 Stierlin Court, Mountain View, CA 94043, and our telephone number is (650) 687-3600. Our\\nwebsite address is www.linkedin.com. We completed our initial public offering in May 2011 and our\\nClass A common stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange (\\u2018\\u2018NYSE\\u2019\\u2019) under the symbol \\u2018\\u2018LNKD\\u2019\\u2019.\\nUnless the context requires otherwise, the words \\u2018\\u2018LinkedIn,\\u2019\\u2019 \\u2018\\u2018we,\\u2019\\u2019 \\u2018\\u2018Company,\\u2019\\u2019 \\u2018\\u2018us\\u2019\\u2019 and \\u2018\\u2018our\\u2019\\u2019 refer to\\nLinkedIn Corporation and our subsidiaries.\\n\\nOur Mission\\n\\nOur mission is to connect the world\\u2019s professionals to make them more productive and successful.\\nWe believe that prioritizing the needs of our members is the most effective and, ultimately, the most\\nprofitable means to accomplish our mission and create long-term value for all stakeholders.\\n\\nOur Vision\\n\\nOur vision is to create economic opportunity for every member of the global workforce. We believe\\nour network\\u2019s ultimate potential is to develop the world\\u2019s first economic graph, a digital representation\\nof the global economy. Manifesting this vision requires scaling across six key pillars: individuals in the\\nworkforce, companies, job opportunities, professional skills, higher education institutions, and\\nprofessional knowledge. By operationalizing this vision, we believe LinkedIn can enable members to\\nconnect to opportunity at global scale.\\n\\nOur Strategy and Value Propositions\\n\\nOur strategy is focused on three key value propositions for both members and customers. These\\nvalue propositions allow us to fully embrace our hybrid model as an enterprise services business built\\n\\n4\\n\\n\\n\\non a consumer web platform and continue to build on critical platform capabilities necessary for\\nprofessionals:\\n\\n\\u2022 Stay connected & informed: Our flagship LinkedIn application and our professional publishing\\nplatform focus on helping members keep up with their connections, stay up to date with relevant\\nnews and ideas, and share views and knowledge. We believe delivering members a relevant\\nand highly engaging feed experience is critical in creating value.\\n\\n\\u2022 Advance my career: Helping members both get hired and learn new skills has emerged as an\\nessential element of our platform. We accelerated this focus through our 2014 acquisition of\\nBright Media Corporation, taking the number of jobs available on LinkedIn to nearly 5 million\\nfrom approximately 300,000 two years ago. In addition, our 2015 acquisition of lynda.com, Inc.\\n(\\u2018\\u2018Lynda.com\\u2019\\u2019), Inc. launched our entrance into the learning and development market by\\nintroducing skills-based learning to our platform.\\n\\n\\u2022 Work smarter: Work smarter captures the value we create for members and customers through\\nour monetized products. For recruiters, LinkedIn provides a destination to attract, recruit, and\\nhire talent. For marketers, LinkedIn provides a platform to market products and services,\\nespecially with a business-to-business focus. For sales professionals, LinkedIn provides a social\\nselling tool to help find leads and generate sales. For individuals, LinkedIn offers premium\\nsubscription packages that are designed for general professionals to manage their professional\\nidentity, grow their networks, and connect with talent. Finally, we recently began to focus on\\nhelping individuals and small businesses find freelance professionals.\\n\\nLinkedIn\\u2019s platform capabilities support these value propositions by enabling a member to:\\nestablish and manage their reputation through their LinkedIn profile, build their professional network,\\nand research and contact any professional on LinkedIn. Lastly, we are committed to making our\\nnetwork accessible on a global basis through mobile-first product offerings.\\n\\nOur Solutions\\n\\nOur solutions are designed to make professionals more productive and successful and to connect\\ntalent with opportunity at massive scale. Our focus is on developing products that enable our members\\nand customers to stay connected and informed, advance their careers, and work smarter.\\n\\nOur principal free and monetized solutions are described below:\\n\\nFree Solutions\\n\\nStay Connected & Informed Advance My Career\\n\\nLinkedIn Flagship: Jobs\\nFeed, Me, Messaging, Job Search App\\nMy Network & Search Company Pages\\nPeople You May Know University Pages\\n\\nPulse Who\\u2019s Viewed Your Profile / How You Rank\\nInfluencers Rich Media / Skills / Endorsements\\n\\nGroups\\nSlideshare\\n\\nLinkedIn Lookup\\nAddress Book Importer\\n\\nPublishing Platform\\n\\nUbiquitous Access\\n\\nLinkedIn Mobile\\nRobust set of APIs\\n\\n5\\n\\n\\n\\nMonetized Solutions\\n\\nWork Smarter\\n\\nTalent Solutions Marketing Solutions Premium Subscriptions\\n\\nHiring Sponsored Updates Professional/Individual\\nLinkedIn Corporate Solutions LinkedIn Ads Subscriptions\\n\\n(Recruiter, Referrals, Job Elevate Sales Solutions (Sales Navigator)\\nSlots, Recruitment Media, Sponsored InMails Profinder\\n\\nCareer Pages) Display Ads\\nLinkedIn Job Postings Ads API\\n\\nJob Seeker\\nRecruiter Lite\\n\\nLearning & Development\\nLynda.com\\n\\nFree Solutions\\n\\nMany of our member solutions are available at no cost and are designed to provide compelling\\nprofessional benefits.\\n\\nStay Connected & Informed\\n\\nLinkedIn Flagship.

No individual\\ncustomer represented more than 10% of our net revenue in 2015, 2014 or 2013.\\n\\nTechnology Infrastructure\\n\\nOur technology platform is designed to create an engaging professional networking experience for\\nour members and is built to enable future growth at scale. We employ technological innovations to\\nincrease efficiency and scale our business.\\n\\nOur products rely upon and leverage the massive amounts of data in our network. This rich\\ndataset has grown exponentially, requiring scalable computing resources. We will continue to invest in\\nbuilding proprietary technologies and using open sourced technologies for our data, search and\\nsolutions. Our product development expense was $775.7 million, $536.2 million and $395.6 million in\\n2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.\\n\\nOur key technology platforms are described below:\\n\\n\\u2022 Professional Graph. Our fully distributed system is comprised of a graph engine where nodes\\ncan represent individuals, companies, schools and other entities and edges can be a connection,\\na \\u2018\\u2018follow,\\u2019\\u2019 or an employee at a given company. The professional graph holds an individual\\u2019s\\nreal-time network and enables a variety of complex calls like establishing the degree by which\\ntwo nodes are connected (e.g., second degree vs. third degree).\\n\\n13\\n\\n\\n\\n\\u2022 Open Sourced Technologies. We deploy aspects of our technology into the open source\\ncommunity to help increase the speed at which the technology can mature. The combination of\\nopen source and proprietary technologies used in our platforms allows us to quickly deploy our\\nproducts at scale. For example, Hadoop is an open source project used to batch compute data\\nfor different features on our website based on our members\\u2019 data and traffic patterns. Hadoop\\nenables us to scale our calculations on an expanding set of data and to perform these\\ncalculations more frequently.\\n\\n\\u2022 Search. Our proprietary search technology combines structured and free-form content to allow\\nusers to search across numerous parameters. Our search is powered by our rich dataset based\\non facets and keywords and is fundamentally personalized as all search requests use a\\nmember\\u2019s network to influence relevance and ranking. Our search is real time, distributed and\\nmultilingual and serves the needs of both members and enterprises and professional\\norganizations.\\n\\n\\u2022 Customized Content, Matching, Targeting and Recommendations. We have developed a\\nproprietary intelligence and recommendation engine for extracting professional insights by\\nutilizing our rich dataset. This engine enables us to provide our users with customized content\\nand recommendations. For example, based on a member\\u2019s profile, their second and third degree\\nconnections, their viewing and clicking history, and a host of other criteria, our algorithms can\\nprovide intelligence and recommendations around Talent Match, People You May Know, Groups\\nYou May Like, Jobs You May Be Interested In, Sponsored Content or Companies You May Be\\nInterested In. Our targeting and recommendation technologies continue beyond just a member\\u2019s\\nprofile by providing intelligence around similar profile views and similar job views.\\n\\n\\u2022 Ad Targeting Platform. We use a combination of traditional and proprietary ad targeting and\\ndelivery technologies. The combination is optimized to work with our respective partners to\\nprovide the optimal user experience. Our proprietary systems leverage our feature extraction,\\ninformation retrieval, and matching systems to provide the most relevant ads.\\n\\n\\u2022 Document Conversion Technologies. We use a combination of open source and proprietary\\ntechnologies to convert documents in various formats (e.g., pdf, doc, ppt) into HTML5, a\\nmark-up language for structuring and presenting content on the Internet, so that the document\\ncan be displayed on LinkedIn.com and Slideshare.net, and embedded throughout the Internet.\\n\\n\\u2022 Service Infrastructure. We have invested and are continuing to invest in updating our online\\napplications to our new service infrastructure, which we believe will improve developer\\nproductivity, agility and operability, and accelerate our mobile strategy.\\n\\n\\u2022 Experimentation Platform. We have developed a testing platform that allows us to evaluate\\ndifferent options for rendering an experience to our members. As a test runs, this platform\\nprovides an in-depth perspective on how the test impacts our metrics. This proprietary\\ntechnology allows us to better evaluate potential changes in our products.\\n\\nOperations\\n\\nWe have developed our website and related infrastructure with the goal of maximizing the\\navailability of our platform to our members, enterprises and professional organizations. Our website and\\nrelated infrastructure are hosted on a network located in multiple third-party facilities, and we lease\\ndata center facilities in various locations.\\n\\nIntellectual Property\\n\\nWe protect our intellectual property rights by relying on various laws and rights in the United States\\nand other countries, as well as contractual restrictions.\\n\\n14\\n\\n\\n\\nWe also rely on a combination of trade secrets, copyrights, trademarks, trade dress, domain\\nnames and patents to protect our intellectual property. We pursue the registration of our domain\\nnames, trademarks, and service marks in the United States and in many locations outside the United\\nStates. Our trademarks and registered trademarks in the United States and other countries include\\n\\u2018\\u2018LinkedIn\\u2019\\u2019 and the \\u2018\\u2018in\\u2019\\u2019 design mark, as well as others. We register copyrights in many of our online\\ntraining videos. We hold a growing portfolio of issued patents of varied duration in the United States\\nand internationally, and regularly file patent applications to protect intellectual property that we believe\\nis important to our business. We believe the duration of our patents is adequate relative to the\\nexpected lives of our products. We seek to protect our trade secrets through a combination of physical\\ncontrols and contractual restrictions. For example, we enter into confidentiality and invention\\nassignment agreements with our employees and contractors, and confidentiality agreements with third\\nparties.\\n\\nCircumstances outside our control could pose a threat to our intellectual property rights. Effective\\nintellectual property protection may not be available in the United States or other countries in which our\\nproducts and solutions are distributed. For example, in many countries the protection of database rights\\ncan be limited. Also, the efforts we have taken to protect our proprietary rights may not be sufficient or\\neffective. Any significant impairment of our intellectual property rights could harm our business or our\\nability to compete. Also, protecting our intellectual property rights is costly and time-consuming. For\\nexample, we expect to spend time and resources policing the unauthorized use and streaming of our\\nonline training videos. Any unauthorized disclosure or use of our intellectual property could make it\\nmore expensive to do business and harm our operating results.\\n\\nCompanies in the Internet, social media technology and other industries may own large numbers\\nof patents, copyrights, and trademarks and may frequently request license agreements, threaten\\nlitigation, or file suit against us based on allegations of infringement or other violations of their\\nintellectual property rights. From time to time, we face, and we expect to face in the future, allegations\\nthat we have infringed the trademarks, copyrights, patents and other intellectual property rights of third\\nparties, including our competitors and non-practicing entities.\\n\\nCompetition\\n\\nWe face significant competition in all aspects of our business, and we expect such competition to\\nincrease, particularly in the market for online professional networks and engagement of professionals.\\nSpecifically, we compete for members, enterprises and professional organizations as discussed below.\\n\\n\\u2022 Members-professional networks. The space for online professional networks is rapidly\\nevolving. Other companies such as Facebook, Google, Microsoft and Twitter are developing or\\ncould develop solutions that compete with ours. Further, some of these companies are\\npartnering with third parties to offer products and services that could compete with ours.\\nAdditionally, we face competition from a number of companies outside the United States that\\nprovide online professional networking solutions. We also compete against smaller companies\\nthat focus on groups of professionals within a specific industry or vertical. Our competitors may\\nannounce new products, services or enhancements that better address changing industry\\nstandards or the needs of members and customers, such as mobile access or different market\\nfocus. Any such increased competition could cause pricing pressure, loss of business or\\ndecreased member activity, any of which could adversely affect our business and operating\\nresults. Internet search engines could also change their methodologies in ways that adversely\\naffect our ability to optimize our page rankings within their search results.\\n\\n\\u2022 Enterprises and professional organizations-Talent Solutions. With respect to our Talent\\nSolutions, we compete with online recruiting companies, talent management companies and\\nlarger companies that are focusing on talent management and human resource services, job\\n\\n15\\n\\n\\n\\nboards, traditional recruiting firms and companies that provide learning and development\\nproducts and services. Additionally, other companies, including newcomers to the recruiting or\\nlearning and development industries, may partner with Internet companies, including social\\nnetworking companies, to provide services that compete with our solutions, either on their own\\nor as third party applications. If the efficiency and usefulness of our products to enterprises and\\nprofessional organizations do not exceed those provided by competitors, we will not be able to\\ncompete successfully.\\n\\n\\u2022 Enterprises and Professional Organizations-Marketing Solutions. With respect to our\\nMarketing Solutions, we compete with online and offline outlets that generate revenue from\\nadvertisers and marketers. To the extent competitors are better able to provide customers with\\ncost-effective access to attractive demographics, either through new business models or\\nincreased user volume, we may not be successful in retaining our existing advertisers or\\nattracting new advertisers, and our business would be harmed.\\n\\n\\u2022 Enterprises and professional organizations-Premium Subscriptions/Sales Solutions. With\\nrespect to our Premium Subscriptions and Sales Solutions, we compete with online and offline\\ncompanies for customers with lead generation and customer intelligence and insights. Our Sales\\nSolutions product is in the early stages, and we may not be able to compete effectively in this\\narea.\\n\\nWe believe that we have competitive strengths that position us favorably in our lines of business.\\nHowever, our industry is evolving rapidly and is becoming increasingly competitive. Larger and more\\nestablished companies may focus on professional networking and could directly compete with us.\\nSmaller companies could also launch new products and services that we do not offer and that could\\ngain market acceptance quickly.\\n\\nGovernment Regulation\\n\\nWe are subject to a number of foreign and domestic laws and regulations that affect companies\\nconducting business online, many of which are evolving and could be interpreted in ways that could\\nharm our business. In the United States and abroad, laws and regulations relating to the liability of\\nproviders of online services for activities of their users and other third parties are being tested by a\\nnumber of claims, including actions based on invasion of privacy and other torts, unfair competition,\\ncopyright and trademark infringement, and other theories based on the nature and content of the\\nmaterials searched, the advertisements posted, or the content provided by users. Further some\\ncountries impose regulations regarding, or require licenses to conduct various aspects of our business,\\nincluding employee recruiting, news related services and online advertising. Any court ruling or other\\ngovernmental action that imposes liability on providers of online services for the activities of their users\\nor other third parties could harm our business. In addition, rising concern about the use of social\\nnetworking technologies for illegal conduct, such as the unauthorized dissemination of national security\\ninformation, money laundering or supporting terrorist activities, may in the future produce legislation or\\nother governmental action that could require changes to our products or services, restrict or impose\\nadditional costs upon the conduct of our business or cause users to abandon material aspects of our\\nservice.\\n\\nIn the area of information security and data protection, most states have enacted laws and\\nregulations requiring notification to users when there is a security breach of personal data, or requiring\\nthe adoption of minimum information security standards that are often vaguely defined and difficult to\\npractically implement. The costs of compliance with these laws and regulations may increase in the\\nfuture as a result of amendments or changes in interpretation. Furthermore, any failure on our part to\\ncomply with these laws and regulations may subject us to significant liabilities.\\n\\n16\\n\\n\\n\\nWe are also subject to federal, state, and foreign laws and regulations regarding privacy and\\nprotection of member data. Our privacy policies and user agreements describe our practices\\nconcerning the use, storage, transmission and disclosure of personal information, including member,\\nvisitor and user data. Any failure by us to comply with these terms or privacy related laws and\\nregulations could result in proceedings against us by governmental authorities or others, which could\\nharm our business. In addition, the interpretation of privacy and data protection laws and regulations\\nand their application to online services are unclear, evolving and in a state of flux. For example, in\\nOctober 2015, the highest court in the European Union invalidated reliance on the US-EU Safe Harbor\\nregime as one of the legally recognized mechanisms under which the personal data of European\\ncitizens could be transferred to the United States. We believe that LinkedIn\\u2019s processing of European\\ncitizens\\u2019 personal data in the United States is authorized under other legally recognized mechanisms,\\nbut the validity of these other legal mechanisms is not certain and may change in light of changes in\\nthe political, legislative and legal environment in Europe. There is a risk that these laws and regulations\\nmay be interpreted and applied in conflicting ways from state to state, country to country, or region to\\nregion, and in a manner that is not consistent with our current data protection practices, or that new\\nlaws or regulations will be enacted. There are a number of legislative proposals pending before US\\nstate and federal legislative bodies and foreign governments concerning privacy and data protection\\nthat could affect us. For example, the European Union recently released a draft regulation expected to\\nbecome law in early 2018 that would result in a comprehensive update of European data protection\\nregulations. In addition, because our services are accessible worldwide, certain foreign governments\\nhave claimed and others may claim that we are required to comply with their laws and regulations,\\nincluding with respect to the storage, use and disclosure of member information, even in jurisdictions\\nwhere we have no local entity, employees, or infrastructure. Complying with these varying domestic\\nand international requirements could cause us to incur additional costs and change our business\\npractices. Further, any failure by us to adequately protect our members\\u2019 privacy and data could result\\nin a loss of member confidence in our services and ultimately in a loss of members and customers,\\nwhich could adversely affect our business.\\n\\nOur Values and Company Culture\\n\\nOur values and unique company culture are the foundation to our success. Our values are the\\nprinciples we use to manage our day-to-day business and facilitate decision-making. Our core values\\nare:\\n\\n\\u2022 Members First. We encourage employees to know and understand our members and to ensure\\nthat we foster the long-term vitality of the LinkedIn ecosystem.\\n\\n\\u2022 Relationships Matter. By fostering trust with colleagues and partners, we all succeed. We\\nfundamentally believe that doing what is right is more important than being right. We manage\\ncompassionately by recognizing that people have experiences and perspectives that may differ\\nfrom our own.\\n\\n\\u2022 Be Open, Honest and Constructive. We expect our employees to communicate with clarity\\nand provide feedback with consistency in a constructive way.\\n\\n\\u2022 Demand Excellence. Our employees are encouraged to lead by example, seek to solve big\\nchallenges, set measureable and actionable goals, and continuously learn, iterate and improve.\\n\\n\\u2022 Take Intelligent Risks. Taking intelligent risks has been paramount in building the company to\\ndate. No matter how large the company becomes, we strive to never lose our startup mentality.\\n\\n\\u2022 Act Like an Owner. Talent is our most important asset. We expect employees to act as an\\nowner in each decision they make, no matter how big or small.\\n\\n17\\n\\n\\n\\nOur culture reflects who we are and the company we aspire to be. It is shaped by our values and\\ndefined by:\\n\\n\\u2022 Transformation. People who work at LinkedIn are here because they seek to make a positive\\nand lasting impact on the world, help realize the full potential of LinkedIn and fundamentally alter\\nthe trajectory of their careers.\\n\\n\\u2022 Integrity. We don\\u2019t believe the ends justify the means. Rather, we expect employees to do the\\nright thing no matter what.\\n\\n\\u2022 Collaboration. Much like the network effects inherent in our business model, we believe that as\\nvaluable as we are as individuals, we are all exponentially more valuable when aligned and\\nworking together.\\n\\n\\u2022 Humor. Fulfilling our mission and vision requires an intense focus so we believe it is important\\nto not take ourselves too seriously and try to have some fun while doing it.\\n\\n\\u2022 Results. We set clear, actionable goals and have high expectations for our performance. We\\ncount on our employees to consistently deliver excellent results, seek leverage through greater\\nefficiency and effectiveness, and demonstrate leadership at all levels throughout the\\norganization.\\n\\nWe believe we have assembled a talented group of employees who are passionate about solving\\nsignificant challenges in our markets. As of December 31, 2015, we had 9,372 employees, consisting\\nof 3,922 employees in engineering, product development and customer operations, 4,147 employees in\\nsales and marketing, and 1,303 employees in general and administrative functions.\\n\\nInformation about Segment and Geographic Revenue\\n\\nInformation about segment and geographic revenue is set forth in Note 16 of the Notes to\\nConsolidated Financial Statements under Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\\n\\nSeasonality\\n\\nOur business is affected by both cyclicality in business activity and seasonal fluctuations in Internet\\nusage. We believe our rapid growth has masked the cyclicality and seasonality of our business. As our\\nrevenue growth rate slows, we expect that the cyclicality and seasonality in our business may become\\nmore pronounced and may in the future cause our operating results to fluctuate. In particular, we\\nexpect new business and renewals of Talent Solutions to be stronger in the fourth quarter of the year\\ndue to budgetary cycles and our Marketing Solutions business to be stronger in the second and fourth\\nquarter of the year in alignment with industry advertising spending.\\n\\nAvailable Information\\n\\nOur website is located at www.linkedin.com, and our investor relations website is located at\\nhttp://investors.linkedin.com/. The following filings are available free of charge through our investor\\nrelations website after we file them with the SEC: Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on\\nForm 10-Q, and our Proxy Statements for our annual meetings of stockholders.\\n\\nWe webcast our earnings calls and certain events we participate in or host with members of the\\ninvestment community on our investor relations website. Additionally, we provide notifications of news\\nor announcements regarding our financial performance, including SEC filings, investor events, press\\nand earnings releases, and blogs as part of our investor relations website. Investors and others can\\nreceive real-time notifications of new information posted on our investor relations website by signing up\\nfor email alerts and RSS feeds. Further corporate governance information, including our certificate of\\nincorporation, bylaws, governance guidelines, board committee charters, and code of conduct, is also\\n\\n18\\n\\n\\n\\navailable on our investor relations website under the heading \\u2018\\u2018Corporate Governance.\\u2019\\u2019 The contents of\\nour websites are not intended to be incorporated by reference into this Annual Report on Form 10-K or\\nin any other report or document we file with the SEC, and any references to our websites are intended\\nto be inactive textual references only. We have used, and intend to continue to use, our investor\\nrelations website, as well as our website (www.linkedin.com), the LinkedIn page\\n(https://www.linkedin.com/company/linkedin), our Twitter feed (https://twitter.com/linkedin) and our\\ncorporate blog (www.blog.linkedin.com), as a means of disclosing material non-public information and\\nfor complying with our disclosure obligations under Regulation FD.\\n\\nItem 1A. Risk Factors\\n\\nInvesting in our Class A common stock involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully\\nconsider the risks and uncertainties described below, together with all of the other information in this\\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K, including our consolidated financial statements and related notes, before\\ndeciding whether to purchase shares of our Class A common stock. If any of the following risks are\\nrealized, our business, operating results and prospects could be materially and adversely affected. In\\nthat event, the price of our Class A common stock could decline, and you could lose part or all of your\\ninvestment.\\n\\nRisks Related to Our Business\\n\\nOur core value of putting our members first may conflict with the short-term interests of our\\nbusiness.\\n\\nOne of our core values is to make decisions based on the best long-term interests of our\\nmembers, which we believe is essential to our success in increasing our member growth rate and\\nengagement, creating value for our members and in serving the best, long-term interests of the\\ncompany and our stockholders. Therefore, in the past, we have forgone, and may in the future forgo,\\ncertain expansion or short-term revenue opportunities that we do not believe are in the best interests of\\nour members, even if our decision negatively impacts our operating results in the short term. In\\naddition, our philosophy of putting our members first may cause disagreements, or negatively impact\\nour relationships, with our existing or prospective customers. This could result in enterprises and\\nprofessional organizations blocking access to our services or refusing to purchase our Talent Solutions,\\nMarketing Solutions or Premium Subscriptions. Our decisions may not result in the long-term benefits\\nthat we expect, in which case our member engagement, business and operating results could be\\nharmed.\\n\\nWe may not timely and effectively scale and adapt our existing technology and network\\ninfrastructure to ensure that our services and solutions are accessible within an acceptable load\\ntime. Additionally, natural disasters or other catastrophic occurrences beyond our control could\\ninterfere with access to our services.\\n\\nA key element to our continued growth is the ability of our members, users (whom we define as\\nanyone who visits one of our websites through a computer or application on a mobile device,\\nregardless of whether or not they are a member), enterprises and professional organizations in all\\ngeographies to access our websites, services and solutions within acceptable load times. We call this\\nwebsite performance. We have experienced, and may in the future experience, service disruptions,\\noutages and other performance problems due to a variety of factors, including infrastructure changes,\\nhuman or software errors, capacity constraints due to an overwhelming number of users accessing our\\nservices simultaneously, and denial of service or fraud or security attacks. In some instances, we may\\nnot be able to identify the cause or causes of these website performance problems within an\\nacceptable period of time. We expect it will become increasingly difficult to maintain and improve our\\nwebsite performance, especially during peak usage times and as our solutions become more complex\\n\\n19\\n\\n\\n\\nand our total user traffic increases. If our services are unavailable when users attempt to access them\\nor they do not load as quickly as users expect, users may seek other websites or services to obtain the\\ninformation for which they are looking, and may not return to our website or use our services as often\\nin the future, or at all. This would negatively impact our ability to attract members, enterprises and\\nprofessional organizations and increase engagement of our members and users. We expect to continue\\nto make significant investments to maintain and improve website performance and to enable rapid\\nreleases of new features and products. To the extent that we do not effectively address capacity\\nconstraints, upgrade our systems as needed and continually develop our technology and network\\narchitecture to accommodate actual and anticipated changes in technology, our business and operating\\nresults may be harmed.\\n\\nWe have implemented a disaster recovery program, which allows us to move production traffic to a\\nbackup data center in the event of a catastrophe. For the majority of our services, we serve traffic out\\nof multiple data centers in parallel. This allows us the ability to move traffic immediately and, in the\\nevent of a problem, the ability to recover in a short period of time. However, some of our services have\\nnot yet migrated to this model and still operate solely in a primary data center. In the event of a\\ndisaster, these services would remain shut down during the transition to a backup data center. To the\\nextent our disaster recovery program does not effectively support the movement of traffic in a timely or\\ncomplete manner in the event of a catastrophe, our business and operating results may be harmed.\\n\\nOur systems are also vulnerable to damage or interruption from catastrophic occurrences such as\\nearthquakes, floods, fires, power loss, telecommunication failures, terrorist attacks and similar events.\\nOur US corporate offices and certain of the facilities we lease to house our computer and\\ntelecommunications equipment are located in the San Francisco Bay Area and Southern California,\\nboth regions known for seismic activity. Despite any precautions we may take, the occurrence of a\\nnatural disaster or other unanticipated problems at our hosting facilities could result in lengthy\\ninterruptions in our services.\\n\\nWe do not carry business interruption insurance sufficient to compensate us for the potentially\\nsignificant losses, including the potential harm to the growth of our business that may result from\\ninterruptions in our service as a result of system failures.\\n\\nIf our security measures are compromised, or if our websites are subject to attacks that\\ndegrade or deny the ability of members or customers to access our solutions, or if our member\\ndata is compromised, members and customers may curtail or stop use of our solutions.\\n\\nOur solutions involve the collection, processing, storage, sharing, disclosure and usage of\\nmembers\\u2019 and customers\\u2019 information and communications, some of which may be private. We also\\nwork with third party vendors to process credit card payments by our customers and are subject to\\npayment card association operating rules. We are vulnerable to software bugs, computer viruses,\\nbreak-ins, phishing attacks, employee errors or malfeasance, attempts to overload our servers with\\ndenial-of-service or other attacks and similar disruptions from unauthorized use of our computer\\nsystems, any of which could lead to interruptions, delays, or website shutdowns, causing loss of critical\\ndata or the unauthorized disclosure or use of personally identifiable or confidential information. For\\nexample, in June 2012, approximately 6.5 million of our members\\u2019 encrypted passwords were stolen\\nand published on an unauthorized website. If we experience compromises to our security that result in\\nwebsite performance or availability problems, the complete shutdown of our websites, or the actual or\\nperceived loss or unauthorized disclosure or use of confidential information, such as credit card\\ninformation, our members or customers may be harmed or lose trust and confidence in us, and\\ndecrease the use of our website, mobile applications and services or stop using our services in their\\nentirety, and we would suffer reputational and financial harm.\\n\\n20\\n\\n\\n\\nIn addition, we may be subject to regulatory investigations or litigation in connection with a security\\nbreach or related issue, and we could also be liable to third parties for these types of breaches. Such\\nlitigation, regulatory investigations and our technical activities intended to prevent future security\\nbreaches are likely to require additional management resources and expenditures. If our security\\nmeasures fail to protect this information adequately or we fail to comply with the applicable credit card\\nassociation operating rules, we could be liable to both our customers for their losses, as well as the\\nvendors under our agreements with them, we could be subject to fines and higher transaction fees, we\\ncould face regulatory action, and our customers and vendors could end their relationships with us, any\\nof which could harm our business and financial results.\\n\\nIf our members\\u2019 profiles are out-of-date, inaccurate or lack the information that users and\\ncustomers want to see, we may not be able to realize the full potential of our network, which\\ncould adversely impact our business.\\n\\nIf our members do not update their information or provide accurate and complete information when\\nthey join LinkedIn, or do not establish sufficient connections, the value of our network may be\\nnegatively impacted because our value proposition as a professional network and as a source of\\naccurate and comprehensive data will be weakened. For example, customers of our Talent Solutions\\nmay not find members that meet their qualifications or may misidentify a candidate as having such\\nqualifications, which could result in mismatches that erode customer confidence in our solutions, or our\\nlearning and development solutions may not suit our customers\\u2019 needs. Similarly, incomplete or\\noutdated member information would diminish the ability of our Marketing or Sales Solutions customers\\nto reach their target audiences and our ability to provide our customers with valuable insights.\\nTherefore, we must provide features and products that demonstrate the value of our network to our\\nmembers and motivate them to contribute additional, timely and accurate information to their profile and\\nour network. If we fail to successfully motivate our members to do so, our business and operating\\nresults could be adversely affected.\\n\\nIf we are unable to effectively operate on mobile devices, our business could be adversely\\naffected.\\n\\nThe number of people who access online services through mobile devices, such as smart phones,\\nhandheld tablets and mobile telephones, as opposed to personal computers, has increased\\ndramatically in the past few years and is projected to continue to increase. If the mobile solutions we\\nhave developed do not meet the needs of prospective members, current members or customers, they\\nmay not sign up or reduce their usage of our platform and our business could suffer. Additionally, we\\nare dependent on the interoperability of LinkedIn with popular mobile operating systems, networks and\\nstandards that we do not control, such as Android and iOS operating systems, and any changes in\\nsuch systems and terms of service that degrade our solutions\\u2019 functionality, give preferential treatment\\nto competitive products or prevent our ability to promote advertising could adversely affect traffic and\\nmonetization on mobile devices. We may not be successful in maintaining and developing relationships\\nwith key participants in the mobile industry or in developing products that operate effectively with these\\ntechnologies, systems, networks, or standards. Each manufacturer or distributor may establish unique\\ntechnical standards for its devices, and our products and services may not work, or be easily\\naccessible or viewable on these devices as a result. Some manufacturers may also elect not to include\\nour products on their devices, or we may have difficulty preparing or loading our applications in app\\nstores. As new devices and platforms are continually being released, it is difficult to predict the\\nchallenges we may encounter in developing versions of our solutions for use on these alternative\\ndevices, and we are devoting significant resources to the support and maintenance of such devices.\\n\\n21\\n\\n\\n\\nGrowth in access to LinkedIn\\u2019s services through mobile devices as a substitute for access on\\npersonal computers may negatively affect our revenue and financial results.\\n\\nOur members are increasingly accessing LinkedIn on mobile devices. While many of our members\\nwho use our online services on mobile devices also access LinkedIn through personal computers, we\\nhave seen substantial growth in mobile usage. We are devoting valuable resources to solutions related\\nto monetization of mobile usage, and cannot assure you that these solutions will be successful. Our\\nmembers are increasingly using mobile devices as a substitute for access to our online services as\\nopposed to personal computers, and if we are unable to successfully implement monetization strategies\\nfor our solutions on mobile devices, or these strategies are not as successful as our offerings for\\npersonal computers, or if we incur excessive expenses in this effort, our financial performance and\\nability to grow revenue would be negatively affected.\\n\\nThe tracking of certain of our performance metrics is done with internal tools and is not\\nindependently verified. Certain of our performance metrics are subject to inherent challenges in\\nmeasurement, and real or perceived inaccuracies in such metrics may harm our reputation and\\nnegatively affect our business.\\n\\nWe track certain performance metrics, including number of registered members, unique visiting\\nmembers and member page views, with internal tools, which are not independently verified by any third\\nparty. Our internal tools have a number of limitations and our methodologies for tracking these metrics\\nmay change over time, which could result in unexpected changes to our metrics, including the metrics\\nwe report. If the internal tools we use to track these metrics undercount or overcount performance or\\ncontain algorithm or other technical errors, the data we report may not be accurate. In addition,\\nlimitations or errors with respect to how we measure data (or the data that we measure) may affect our\\nunderstanding of certain details of our business, which could affect our longer term strategies. If our\\nperformance metrics are not accurate representations of our business, member base or traffic levels; if\\nwe discover material inaccuracies in our metrics; or if the metrics we rely on to track our performance\\ndo not provide an accurate measurement of our business, our reputation may be harmed and our\\noperating and financial results could be adversely affected, causing our stock price to decline.\\n\\nThe number of our registered members is higher than the number of actual members and a\\nsubstantial majority of our traffic is generated by a minority of our members. Our business may\\nbe adversely impacted if we are unable to attract and retain additional members who actively\\nuse our services.\\n\\nThe number of registered members in our network is higher than the number of actual members\\nbecause some members have multiple registrations, other members have died or become\\nincapacitated, and others may have registered under fictitious names or created fraudulent accounts.\\nWhile the number of registered members represents what we believe to be reasonable estimates of our\\nmember base, there are inherent challenges in ensuring that the number of registered members\\npresents an accurate reflection of our member network. For example, we do not have a reliable system\\nfor identifying and counting duplicate or fraudulent accounts, or deceased, incapacitated or other\\nnon-members and so we rely on estimates and assumptions, which may not be accurate. In addition,\\nour methodology for measuring our membership numbers, and specifically for making estimates\\nregarding non-members who should not be included as registered members, has changed over time\\nand may continue to change from time to time. While we are using what we believe to be reasonable\\nand appropriate methods of measuring the number of registered members, there are no methodologies\\navailable that would provide us with an exact number of non-actual member types of accounts.\\nTherefore, we cannot assure you that our current or future methodologies are accurate, and we will\\nneed to continue to adjust them in the future from time to time, which could result in the number of\\nregistered members being lower or higher than expected. Further, a substantial majority of our\\n\\n22\\n\\n\\n\\nmembers do not visit our websites on a monthly basis, and a substantial majority of our desktop and\\nmobile traffic is generated by a minority of our members. If the number of our actual members does not\\nmeet our expectations, if the rate at which we add new members slows or declines or if we are unable\\nto increase the breadth and frequency of our visiting members, then our business may not grow as fast\\nas we expect.\\n\\nOur solutions and internal systems rely on software that is highly technical, and if it contains\\nundetected errors, our business could be adversely affected.\\n\\nOur solutions and internal systems rely on software that is highly technical and complex. In\\naddition, our solutions and internal systems depend on the ability of our software to store, retrieve,\\nprocess, and manage immense amounts of data. Our software has contained, and may now or in the\\nfuture contain, undetected errors, bugs, or vulnerabilities. Some errors in our software may only be\\ndiscovered after the code has been released for external or internal use. Errors or other design defects\\nwithin our software may result in a negative experience for members or customers, delay product\\nintroductions or enhancements, or result in measurement or other errors. We also rely on third party\\nsoftware that may contain errors or bugs. Any errors, bugs, or defects discovered in our software or\\nthird party software we use could result in damage to our reputation, loss of members, loss of revenue,\\nor liability for damages, any of which could adversely affect our business and financial results.\\n\\nWe collect, process, store, share, disclose and use personal information and other data, which\\nsubjects us to governmental regulations and other legal obligations related to privacy and\\nsecurity, and our actual or perceived failure to comply with such obligations could harm our\\nbusiness.\\n\\nWe collect, process, store, share, disclose and use information from and about our members,\\ncustomers and users, including personal information and other data, and we enable our members to\\npassively and proactively share their personal information with each other and with third parties and to\\ncommunicate and share news and other information into and across our platform. There are numerous\\nlaws around the world regarding privacy and security, including laws regarding the collection,\\nprocessing, storage, sharing, disclosure, use and security of personal information and other data from\\nand about our members and users. The scope of these laws is changing, subject to differing\\ninterpretations, may be costly to comply with, and may be inconsistent among countries and\\njurisdictions or conflict with other rules.\\n\\nWe strive to comply with applicable laws, policies, and legal obligations and certain applicable\\nindustry codes of conduct (such as the Digital Advertising Alliance\\u2019s self-regulatory principles for online\\nbehavioral advertising) relating to privacy and data protection and are subject to the terms of our\\nprivacy policies and privacy-related obligations to third parties. However, these obligations may be\\ninterpreted and applied in new ways and/or in a manner that is inconsistent from one jurisdiction to\\nanother and may conflict with other rules or our practices. Data privacy and security are active areas\\nand new laws and regulations are likely to be enacted.\\n\\nAny failure or perceived failure by us to comply with our privacy policies, our privacy-related\\nobligations to members, customers or other third parties, our data disclosure and consent obligations,\\nor our privacy or security-related legal obligations, or any compromise of security that results in the\\nunauthorized disclosure, transfer or use of personal or other information, which may include personally\\nidentifiable information or other member data, may result in governmental enforcement actions,\\nlitigation or public statements critical of us by consumer advocacy groups or others and could cause\\nour members and customers to lose trust in us, which could have an adverse effect on our business.\\nAdditionally, if third parties we work with, such as customers, vendors or developers, violate applicable\\nlaws, our policies or other privacy or security-related obligations, such violations may also put our\\nmembers\\u2019 information at risk and could in turn have an adverse effect on our business. Governmental\\n\\n23\\n\\n\\n\\nagencies may also request or take member or customer data for national security or informational\\npurposes, and also can make data requests in connection with criminal or civil investigations or other\\nmatters, which could harm our reputation and our business.\\n\\nIn addition, the EU-US Safe Harbor program (\\u2018\\u2018Safe Harbor\\u2019\\u2019), which provided a valid legal basis for\\ntransfers of personal data from Europe to the United States, was recently held to be invalid, which has\\na significant impact on the transfer of data from the European Union to US companies, including us.\\nWhile we have other legally recognized mechanisms in place that we believe allow for the transfer of\\nEU member and customer and employee information to the United States, it is possible that these\\nmechanisms may also be challenged or evolve to include new legal requirements that could have an\\nimpact on how we move data from the European Union to LinkedIn entities outside the European\\nUnion. Recently, the United States and the European Union agreed in principle upon the Privacy Shield\\nas a potential replacement for the Safe Harbor, but it has not yet been finalized, published or\\ninterpreted. The Privacy Shield may add significant requirements that could impact our business and\\nresult in substantial expense to implement, and it is unclear that it will be appropriate for us. In\\nresponse to these regulatory changes, we may have to require some of our vendors who process\\npersonal data to take on additional privacy and security obligations, and some may refuse, causing us\\nto incur potential disruption and expense related to our business processes. If our policies and\\npractices, or those of our vendors, are, or are perceived to be, insufficient or if our members and\\ncustomers have concerns regarding the transfer of data from the European Union to the United States,\\nwe could be subject to enforcement actions or investigations by individual EU Data Protection\\nAuthorities or lawsuits by private parties, member engagement could decline and our business could be\\nnegatively impacted.\\n\\nPublic scrutiny of Internet privacy and security issues may result in increased regulation and\\ndifferent industry standards, which could deter or prevent us from providing our current\\nproducts and solutions to our members and customers, thereby harming our business.\\n\\nThe regulatory framework for privacy and security issues worldwide is evolving and is likely to\\nremain in flux for the foreseeable future. Various government and consumer agencies have also called\\nfor new regulation and changes in industry practices. Practices regarding the registration, collection,\\nprocessing, storage, sharing, disclosure, use and security of personal and other information by\\ncompanies offering online services have recently come under increased public scrutiny.\\n\\nFor example, the European Union is anticipated to enact a new General Data Protection\\nRegulation, which will likely become effective in 2018. The General Data Protection Regulation is\\nexpected to result in significantly greater compliance burdens for companies with users and operations\\nin the European Union and to provide for considerable fines of up to 4% of global annual revenues for\\nnoncompliance. The European Union is also considering an update to the EU\\u2019s Privacy and Electronic\\nCommunications (e-Privacy) Directive to, among other things, amend the current directive\\u2019s rules on the\\nuse of cookies.\\n\\nIn the United States, the federal government, including the White House, the Federal Trade\\nCommission, the Department of Commerce and Congress, and many state governments are reviewing\\nthe need for greater regulation of the collection, processing, storage, sharing, disclosure, use and\\nsecurity of information concerning consumer behavior with respect to online services, including\\nregulations aimed at restricting certain targeted advertising practices and collection and use of data\\nfrom mobile devices. This review may result in new laws or the promulgation of new regulations or\\nguidelines. For example, the State of California and other states have passed laws relating to\\ndisclosure of companies\\u2019 practices with regard to Do-Not-Track signals from Internet browsers, the\\nability to delete information of minors, and new data breach notification requirements. California has\\nalso adopted privacy guidelines with respect to mobile applications. Outside the European Union and\\n\\n24\\n\\n\\n\\nthe United States, a number of countries have adopted or are considering privacy laws and regulations\\nthat may result in significant greater compliance burdens.\\n\\nIn addition, government agencies and regulators have reviewed, are reviewing and will continue to\\nreview, the personal data practices of online media companies including our privacy and security\\npolicies and practices. The FTC in particular has approved consent decrees resolving complaints and\\ntheir resulting investigations into the privacy and security practices of a number of online social media\\ncompanies. These reviews can and have resulted in changes to our products and policies, and could\\nresult in additional changes in the future. If we are unable to comply with any such reviews or decrees\\nthat result in recommendations or binding changes, or if the recommended changes result in\\ndegradation of our products, our business could be harmed.\\n\\nOur business, including our ability to operate and expand internationally or on new technology\\nplatforms, could be adversely affected if legislation or regulations are adopted, interpreted or\\nimplemented in a manner that is inconsistent with our current business practices and that require\\nchanges to these practices, the design of our websites, mobile applications, products, features or our\\nprivacy policy. In particular, the success of our business has been, and we expect will continue to be,\\ndriven by our ability to responsibly use data about our members. Therefore, our business could be\\nharmed by any significant change to applicable laws, regulations or industry standards or practices\\nregarding the storage, use or disclosure of data our members choose to share with us, or regarding the\\nmanner in which the express or implied consent of consumers for such use and disclosure is obtained.\\nSuch changes may require us to modify our products and features, possibly in a material manner, and\\nmay limit our ability to develop new products and features that make use of the data that we collect\\nabout our members.\\n\\nOur business is subject to a variety of US and foreign laws, many of which are unsettled and\\nstill developing and which could subject us to claims or otherwise harm our business.\\n\\nWe are subject to a variety of laws in the United States and abroad, including laws regarding\\nprivacy, data protection, data security, data retention and consumer protection, accessibility, sending\\nelectronic messages, human resource services and the provision of online payment services, including\\ncredit card processing, which are continuously evolving and developing. In addition, some of our\\nmembers are subject to laws and/or licensing or certification obligations that may restrict their ability to\\nengage with LinkedIn\\u2019s online services. The scope and interpretation of the laws and other obligations\\nthat are or may be applicable to us or certain groups of our members are often uncertain and may be\\nconflicting, particularly laws and other obligations outside the United States. For example, laws related\\nto the online dissemination of content of others and laws related to sending messages over online\\nservice are continuing to evolve and are being tested pursuant to actions based on, among other\\nthings, invasion of privacy, defamation, spam, and other torts, unfair competition, copyright and\\ntrademark infringement, credit reporting and other theories based on the nature and content of the\\nmaterials and messages sent or provided by others.\\n\\nIn addition, regulatory authorities around the world are considering a number of legislative and\\nregulatory proposals concerning privacy, spam, data storage, data protection, content regulation,\\ncybersecurity, government access to personal information and other matters that may be applicable to\\nour business. Compliance with these laws may require substantial investment or may provide technical\\nchallenges for our business. It is also likely that as our business grows, evolves, and an increasing\\nportion of our business shifts to mobile, and our solutions are used in a greater number of countries\\nand additional groups, we will become subject to laws and regulations in additional jurisdictions.\\nFurther, as our services and solutions expand to include more content (including from third parties),\\nadditional laws and regulations may become applicable to our products and offerings including laws\\nrequiring us to restrict the availability of such content on a geographical basis or to certain groups of\\nmembers. In some cases, laws and legal obligations of various jurisdictions may be ambiguous or\\n\\n25\\n\\n\\n\\nconflict as to LinkedIn\\u2019s right to display and distribute certain content as part of its online services.\\nUsers of our site and our solutions could also abuse or misuse our products in ways that violate laws.\\nIt is difficult to predict how existing laws will be applied to our business and the new laws and legal\\nobligations to which we may become subject.\\n\\nIf we are not able to comply with these laws or other legal obligations or if we (or our members)\\nbecome liable under these laws or legal obligations, or if our services are suspended or blocked, we\\ncould be directly harmed, and we may be forced to implement new measures to reduce exposure to\\nthis liability. This may require us to expend substantial resources or to discontinue certain solutions,\\nwhich would negatively affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, the\\nincreased attention focused upon liability issues as a result of lawsuits and legislative proposals could\\nharm our reputation or otherwise impact the growth of our business. Any costs incurred as a result of\\nthis potential liability could harm our business and operating results.\\n\\nWe face competition in the market for online professional networks from social networking sites\\nand Internet search companies, among others, as well as continued competition for customers.\\n\\nWe face significant competition in all aspects of our business, and we expect such competition to\\nincrease, particularly in the market for online professional networks and engagement of professionals.\\n\\nOur industry is evolving rapidly and is becoming increasingly competitive. Larger and more\\nestablished companies may focus on our market and could directly compete with us. Smaller\\ncompanies, including application developers, could also launch new products and services that\\ncompete with us and that could gain market acceptance quickly. We may also face competition if we\\nshift our focus of development to new or different products or separate areas of our business.\\n\\nWe expect our existing competitors in the markets for Talent Solutions, Marketing Solutions and\\nPremium Subscriptions (including Sales Solutions) to continue to focus on these areas. A number of\\nthese companies may have greater resources than us, which may enable them to compete more\\neffectively. Specifically, we are investing significantly in our Marketing Solutions products with respect\\nto content and mobile solutions, and we may not be as successful as our competitors in generating\\nrevenue through new forms of content marketing or mobile advertising. Additionally, users of social\\nnetworks may choose to use, or increase their use of, those networks for professional purposes, which\\nmay result in those users decreasing or eliminating their use of LinkedIn. Companies that currently\\nfocus on social networking could also expand their focus to professionals. We and other companies\\nhave historically established alliances and relationships with some of these companies to allow broader\\nexposure to users and access to data on the Internet. We may also, in the future, establish alliances or\\nrelationships with other competitors or potential competitors. To the extent companies terminate such\\nrelationships and establish alliances and relationships with others, our business could be harmed.\\nAdditionally, other companies that provide content for professionals could develop more compelling\\nofferings than ours. This could impact the engagement of our members, and could also compete with\\nour Premium Subscriptions and adversely impact our ability to sell and renew subscriptions to our\\nmembers. Specifically, we compete for members, enterprises and professional organizations as\\ndiscussed below.\\n\\nMembers-professional networks. The space for online professional networks is rapidly evolving.\\nOther companies such as Facebook, Google, Microsoft and Twitter are developing or could develop\\nsolutions that compete with ours. Further, some of these companies are partnering with third parties to\\noffer products and services that could compete with ours. Additionally, we face competition from a\\nnumber of companies outside the United States that provide online professional networking solutions.\\nWe also compete against smaller companies that focus on groups of professionals within a specific\\nindustry or vertical. Our competitors may announce new products, services or enhancements that better\\naddress changing industry standards or the needs of members and customers, such as mobile access\\n\\n26\\n\\n\\n\\nor different market focus. Any such increased competition could cause pricing pressure, loss of\\nbusiness or decreased member activity, any of which could adversely affect our business and operating\\nresults. Internet search engines could also change their methodologies in ways that adversely affect\\nour ability to optimize our page rankings within their search results.\\n\\nEnterprises and professional organizations-Talent Solutions. With respect to our Talent Solutions,\\nwe compete with online recruiting companies, talent management companies and larger companies\\nthat are focusing on talent management and human resource services, job boards, traditional recruiting\\nfirms, and companies that provide learning and development products and services. Additionally, other\\ncompanies, including newcomers to the recruiting or learning and development industries, may partner\\nwith Internet companies, including social networking companies, to provide services that compete with\\nour solutions, either on their own or as third party applications. If the efficiency and usefulness of our\\nproducts to enterprises and professional organizations do not exceed those provided by competitors,\\nwe will not be able to compete successfully.\\n\\nEnterprises and professional organizations-Marketing Solutions. With respect to our Marketing\\nSolutions, we compete with online and offline outlets that generate revenue from advertisers and\\nmarketers. To the extent competitors are better able to provide customers with cost-effective access to\\nattractive demographics, either through new business models or increased user volume, we may not be\\nsuccessful in retaining our existing advertisers or attracting new advertisers, and our business would be\\nharmed.\\n\\nEnterprises and professional organizations-Premium Subscriptions/Sales Solutions. With respect\\nto our Premium Subscriptions and Sales Solutions, we compete with online and offline companies for\\ncustomers with lead generation and customer intelligence and insights. Our Sales Solutions product is\\nin the early stages, and we may not be able to compete effectively in this area.\\n\\nIf we do not continue to attract new customers, or if existing customers do not renew their\\nsubscriptions, renew on less favorable terms, or fail to purchase additional solutions, we may\\nnot achieve our revenue projections, and our operating results would be harmed.\\n\\nIn order to grow our business, we must continually attract new customers, sell additional solutions\\nto existing customers and reduce the level of non-renewals in our business. Our ability to do so\\ndepends in large part on the success of our sales and marketing efforts. We do not typically enter into\\nlong-term contracts with our customers, and even when we do, they can generally terminate their\\nrelationship with us. We may not accurately predict future trends with respect to rates of customer\\nrenewals, upgrades and expansions. Furthermore, the nature of our products and solutions is such that\\ncustomers may decide to terminate or not renew their agreements with us without causing significant\\ndisruptions to their own businesses.\\n\\nWe must demonstrate that our Talent Solutions are important recruiting and learning and\\ndevelopment tools for enterprises, professional organizations, and individuals and that our Marketing\\nand Sales Solutions provide them with access to an audience of one of the most influential, affluent\\nand highly educated audiences on the Internet. However, potential customers may not be familiar with\\nour solutions or may prefer other or more traditional products and services for their talent, advertising\\nand marketing needs.\\n\\n27\\n\\n\\n\\nOur customer base and our customers\\u2019 renewal rates may decline or fluctuate because of several\\nfactors, including the prices of our solutions, the prices of products and services offered by our\\ncompetitors, reduced hiring by our customers or reductions in their talent or marketing spending levels\\ndue to macroeconomic or other factors and the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of our solutions. If we\\ndo not attract new customers or if our customers do not renew their agreements for our solutions,\\nrenew on less favorable terms, or do not purchase additional functionality or offerings, our revenue may\\ngrow more slowly than expected or decline.\\n\\nUltimately, attracting new customers and retaining existing customers requires that we continue to\\nprovide high quality solutions that our customers value. In particular, our Talent Solutions customers\\nwill discontinue their purchases of our solutions if we fail to effectively connect them with the talent they\\nseek or provide learning and development opportunities that they are looking for, and our premium\\nsubscribers will discontinue their subscriptions if they do not find the networking and business\\nopportunities that they value. Similarly, customers of our Marketing Solutions will not continue to do\\nbusiness with us if their advertisements do not reach their intended audiences. Therefore we must\\ncontinue to demonstrate to our customers that using our Marketing Solutions is the most effective and\\ncost-efficient way to maximize their results. Even if our Marketing Solutions are providing value to our\\ncustomers, advertisers are sensitive to general economic downturns and reductions in consumer\\nspending, among other events and trends, which generally results in reduced advertising expenditures\\nand could adversely affect sales of our Marketing Solutions. In addition, we have recently expanded\\nour Marketing Solutions products to include off-network advertising. This product area will complement\\nour current offerings primarily sold on our wholly owned properties, and we may not be successful or\\nour customers or members may not be receptive to these products. Finally, for our Sales Solutions\\nproducts, we may not be able to retain existing customers or attract new customers if we fail to provide\\nhigh quality solutions, if customers are unable to realize the value our solutions, or if we are not able to\\nmeasure and demonstrate the value that our solutions provide.\\n\\nWe expect our operating results to fluctuate on a quarterly and annual basis, which may result\\nin a decline in our stock price if such fluctuations result in a failure to meet the expectations of\\nsecurities analysts or investors.\\n\\nOur revenue and operating results have in the past and could in the future vary significantly from\\nquarter-to-quarter and year-to-year and may fail to match our past performance, our projections or the\\nexpectations of securities analysts because of a variety of factors, many of which are outside of our\\ncontrol. Any of these events could cause the market price of our Class A common stock to fluctuate.\\nFactors that may contribute to the variability of our operating results include:\\n\\n\\u2022 our ability to create value for our members as well as increase the size of our member base;\\n\\n\\u2022 engagement of our members and customers;\\n\\n\\u2022 our commitment to putting our members first even if it means forgoing short-term revenue\\nopportunities;\\n\\n\\u2022 shifts in the way members and users access our websites and services from personal computers\\nto mobile devices;\\n\\n\\u2022 disruptions or outages in the availability of our websites or services, actual or perceived\\nbreaches of privacy, and compromises of our member data;\\n\\n\\u2022 changes in our pricing policies or those of our competitors;\\n\\n\\u2022 our ability to increase sales of our products and solutions to new customers and expand sales of\\nadditional products and solutions to our existing customers;\\n\\n\\u2022 the size and seasonal variability of our customers\\u2019 recruiting, marketing and sales budgets;\\n\\n28\\n\\n\\n\\n\\u2022 the extent to which existing customers renew their agreements with us and the timing and terms\\nof those renewals;\\n\\n\\u2022 general industry and macroeconomic conditions, in particular, deterioration in labor markets,\\nwhich would adversely impact sales of our Talent Solutions, or economic growth that does not\\nlead to job growth, for instance increases in productivity;\\n\\n\\u2022 the cost of investing in our technology infrastructure, product initiatives, facilities and international\\nexpansion may be greater than we anticipate;\\n\\n\\u2022 our needs related to facilities may change over time and vary from our original forecasts, and\\nthe value of the property that we lease or own may fluctuate;\\n\\n\\u2022 expenses related to hiring, incentivizing and retaining employees;\\n\\n\\u2022 the timing and costs of expanding our field sales organization and delays or inability in achieving\\nexpected productivity;\\n\\n\\u2022 the timing of certain expenditures, including hiring of employees and capital expenditures;\\n\\n\\u2022 the entrance of new competitors in our market whether by established companies or the\\nentrance of new companies;\\n\\n\\u2022 currency exchange rate fluctuations;\\n\\n\\u2022 our ability to integrate acquisitions and realize the expected benefit of such acquisitions in a\\ntimely manner or at all; and\\n\\n\\u2022 changing tax laws and regulations.\\n\\nOur historical operating results may not be indicative of our future operating results. We believe\\nour rapid growth has masked the cyclicality and seasonality of our business. As our revenue growth\\nrate has slowed, the cyclicality and seasonality in our business has become more pronounced, and we\\nexpect that to continue. This has, and will, cause our operating results to fluctuate. In addition, global\\neconomic concerns continue to create uncertainty and unpredictability and add risk to our future\\noutlook. Sovereign debt issues and economic uncertainty in the United States, Europe and around the\\nworld raise concerns in markets important to our business. An economic downturn in any particular\\nregion in which we do business or globally could result in reductions in sales of our products,\\ndecreased renewals of existing arrangements and other adverse effects that could harm our operating\\nresults.\\n\\nWe expect our revenue growth rate to decline, and, as our costs increase, we may not be able\\nto generate sufficient revenue to sustain profitability over the long term.\\n\\nFrom 2010 to 2015, our annual net revenue grew from $243.1 million to $2,990.9 million, which\\nrepresents a compounded annual growth rate of approximately 65.2%. As our net revenue has\\nincreased, our revenue growth rate has slowed, and we expect that it will continue to decline over time.\\nWe also expect that the growth rates of each of our primary product lines will fluctuate and that these\\nproduct lines may not grow at the same rate. In recent years, and continuing in 2016, our philosophy\\nhas been to invest for future growth. We expect to continue to expend substantial financial and other\\nresources on:\\n\\n\\u2022 our technology infrastructure, including architecture, development tools scalability, availability,\\nperformance and security, as well as disaster recovery measures;\\n\\n\\u2022 product development, including investments in our product development team and the\\ndevelopment of new features for both members and customers;\\n\\n29\\n\\n\\n\\n\\u2022 sales and marketing, including a significant expansion of our field sales organization;\\n\\n\\u2022 international expansion in an effort to increase our member base, member activity and sales;\\n\\n\\u2022 general administration, including legal and accounting expenses related to our expanding global\\npresence and the integration of newly acquired businesses; and\\n\\n\\u2022 capital expenditures, including facilities and build-out of our data centers.\\n\\nThese investments may not result in increased revenue or business growth, or increased network\\ngrowth or member value, and will increase our expenses. Even if our revenue continues to increase,\\nwe expect that due to increased expenses, in particular, stock-based compensation, depreciation and\\namortization and provision for income taxes, we may incur a US GAAP loss during future periods. If we\\nfail to continue to grow our revenue and overall business, our operating results and business would be\\nharmed.\\n\\nIf we fail to effectively manage our growth, our business and operating results could be harmed.\\n\\nWe continue to experience rapid growth in our headcount and operations, which will continue to\\nplace significant demands on our management and our operational and financial infrastructure. As of\\nDecember 31, 2015, approximately 35% of our employees had been with us for less than one year and\\napproximately 59% for less than two years. As we continue to grow, we must effectively integrate,\\ndevelop and motivate a large number of new employees in various countries around the world, and we\\nmust maintain the beneficial aspects of our corporate culture. We intend to continue to make\\nsubstantial investments to expand our engineering, research and development, field sales, and general\\nand administrative organizations, and our international operations. To attract top talent, we have had to\\noffer, and believe we will need to continue to offer, highly competitive compensation packages before\\nwe can validate the productivity of those employees. In addition, fluctuations in the price of our Class A\\ncommon stock may make it more difficult or costly to use equity compensation to motivate, incentivize\\nand retain our employees. We face significant competition for talent from other Internet and high-growth\\ncompanies, which include both publicly traded and privately-held companies. The risks of over-hiring\\n(especially given overall macroeconomic risks) or over-compensating employees and the challenges of\\nintegrating a rapidly growing employee base into our corporate culture are exacerbated by our\\ninternational expansion. Additionally, because of our growth, we have significantly expanded our\\noperating lease and purchase commitments, which have increased our expenses. We may not be able\\nto hire new employees quickly enough to meet our needs. If we fail to effectively manage our hiring\\nneeds and successfully integrate our new hires, our efficiency and ability to meet our forecasts and our\\nemployee morale, productivity and retention could suffer, and our business and operating results could\\nbe adversely affected.\\n\\nAdditionally, if we do not effectively manage the growth of our business and operations, the quality\\nof our solutions could suffer, which could negatively affect our brand, operating results and overall\\nbusiness. Further, we have made changes in the past, and will make changes in the future, to our\\nfeatures, products and services that our members or customers may not like, find useful or agree with.\\nWe may also decide to discontinue certain features, products or services, or charge for certain\\nfeatures, products or services that are currently free or increase fees for any of our features, products\\nor services. If members or customers are unhappy with these changes, they may decrease their\\nengagement on our site, or stop using features, products or services or the site generally. In addition,\\nthey may choose to take other types of action against us such as organizing petitions or boycotts\\nfocused on our company, our website or any of our services, filing claims with the government or other\\nregulatory bodies, or filing lawsuits against us. Any of these actions could negatively impact our\\nmember growth and engagement and our brand, which would harm our business. To effectively\\n\\n30\\n\\n\\n\\nmanage this growth, we will need to continue to improve our operational, financial and management\\ncontrols, and our reporting systems and procedures by, among other things:\\n\\n\\u2022 improving our information technology infrastructure to maintain the effectiveness of our solutions;\\n\\n\\u2022 enhancing information and communication systems to ensure that our employees and offices\\naround the world are well-coordinated and can effectively communicate with each other and our\\ngrowing base of members, enterprises and professional organizations;\\n\\n\\u2022 enhancing our internal controls to ensure timely and accurate reporting of all of our operations;\\nand\\n\\n\\u2022 appropriately documenting our information technology systems and our business processes.\\n\\nThese systems enhancements and improvements will require significant capital expenditures and\\nallocation of valuable management and employee resources. If we fail to implement these\\nimprovements effectively, our ability to manage our expected growth and comply with the rules and\\nregulations that are applicable to publicly reporting companies will be impaired.\\n\\nWe depend on world class talent to grow and operate our business, and if we are unable to\\nhire, retain and motivate our personnel, we may not be able to grow effectively.\\n\\nOur future success will depend upon our continued ability to identify, hire, develop, motivate and\\nretain world class talent. Our ability to execute efficiently is dependent upon contributions from all of\\nour employees, in particular our senior management team. Key institutional knowledge remains with a\\nsmall group of long-term employees whom we may not be able to retain. We may not be able to retain\\nthe services of any of our long-term employees or other members of senior management in the future.\\nWe do not have employment agreements other than offer letters with any of our key employees, and\\nwe do not maintain key person life insurance for any employee. In addition, from time to time, there\\nmay be changes in our senior management team that may be disruptive to our business. If our senior\\nmanagement team, including any new hires that we may make, fails to work together effectively and to\\nexecute our plans and strategies on a timely basis, our business could be harmed.\\n\\nOur growth strategy also depends on our ability to expand and retain our organization with world\\nclass talent. Identifying, recruiting, training and integrating qualified individuals will require significant\\ntime, expense and attention. In addition to hiring new employees, we must continue to focus on\\nretaining our best talent. Competition for these resources, particularly for engineers, is intense, and\\ncompetition for the facilities to house our employees is also intense, specifically in the San Francisco\\nBay Area, where our headquarters is located. We may need to invest significant amounts of cash and\\nequity for new and existing employees and we may never realize returns on these investments, and we\\nalso are investing heavily in our facilities. If we are not able to effectively increase and retain our talent,\\nour ability to achieve our strategic objectives will be adversely impacted, and our business will be\\nharmed.\\n\\nOur international operations account for a significant portion of our revenue and are subject to\\nincreased challenges and risks.\\n\\nWe have offices around the world and our websites and mobile applications are available in\\nnumerous languages. For the year ended December 31, 2015, international revenue represented 38%\\nof our total revenue. We expect to continue to expand our international operations in the future by\\nopening offices in different countries and expanding our offerings in new languages. Our ability to\\nmanage our business and conduct our operations internationally, including in emerging markets,\\nrequires considerable management attention and resources and is subject to the particular challenges\\nof supporting a rapidly growing business in an environment of multiple languages, cultures, customs,\\nlegal systems, alternative dispute resolution systems, regulatory systems and commercial\\n\\n31\\n\\n\\n\\ninfrastructures. International expansion has required and will continue to require us to invest significant\\nfunds and other resources. Operating internationally subjects us to new risks and may increase risks\\nthat we currently face, including risks associated with:\\n\\n\\u2022 recruiting and retaining talented and capable employees in foreign countries, and maintaining our\\ncompany culture across all of our offices;\\n\\n\\u2022 providing solutions across a significant distance, in different languages, in competitive market\\nenvironments and among different cultures, including modifying, or in some cases building\\nentirely new services, solutions and features to ensure that they are culturally relevant in\\ndifferent countries and conforming to local laws and regulations, which may include modifying or\\nblocking content in certain jurisdictions if it is deemed objectionable or unlawful;\\n\\n\\u2022 increased competition from local websites and services that provide online professional\\nnetworking solutions, online recruitment services and learning and development products, which\\nmay benefit from first-mover advantages. These competitors have expanded and may continue\\nto expand their geographic footprint;\\n\\n\\u2022 differing and potentially lower levels of member growth and activity in new and nascent\\ngeographies;\\n\\n\\u2022 compliance with applicable foreign laws and regulations, which may change or conflict with each\\nother, require us to take on additional compliance obligations and practices as well as the\\npotential risk of penalties to individual members of management if our practices are deemed to\\nbe out of compliance;\\n\\n\\u2022 longer payment cycles in some countries;\\n\\n\\u2022 credit risk and higher levels of payment fraud;\\n\\n\\u2022 stringent local labor laws and regulations;\\n\\n\\u2022 laws and regulations that favor local competitors or prohibit or limit foreign ownership of\\nbusinesses;\\n\\n\\u2022 legal regimes where the application of laws and regulations is subject to greater uncertainty, as\\nwell as higher risk of corruption, fraud and unethical business practices, and compliance with\\nanti-bribery laws;\\n\\n\\u2022 implementing and maintaining effective internal processes and controls;\\n\\n\\u2022 compliance with various economic and trade sanctions regulations which restrict certain conduct\\nof business;\\n\\n\\u2022 currency exchange rate fluctuations and controls;\\n\\n\\u2022 political or social unrest, or, economic instability in some countries;\\n\\n\\u2022 laws and proposed legislation relating to data localization in various countries, which may restrict\\nour ability to do business in new and existing markets;\\n\\n\\u2022 double taxation of our non-US earnings and potentially adverse tax consequences due to\\nchanges in the tax laws of the United States or the foreign jurisdictions in which we operate; and\\n\\n\\u2022 higher costs of doing business internationally.\\n\\nIf our revenue from our international operations, and particularly from our operations in the\\ncountries and regions on which we have focused our spending, do not exceed the expense of\\nestablishing and maintaining these operations, our business and operating results will suffer. In\\n\\n32\\n\\n\\n\\naddition, as our member base expands internationally, members in certain geographies may have lower\\nlevels of activity with our websites and services.\\n\\nFinally, in late 2013, we established a joint venture to expand our operations in the People\\u2019s\\nRepublic of China (\\u2018\\u2018PRC\\u2019\\u2019), which is in its early stages. Although we believe this joint venture and our\\nactivities in the PRC comply with existing laws, they involve unique risks, and the PRC is actively\\nconsidering changes in its foreign investment rules that could impact this structure and our activities.\\nThere are substantial uncertainties regarding the interpretation of PRC laws and regulations, and it is\\npossible that the government will ultimately take a view contrary to ours. We may be unable to continue\\nto operate in the PRC if we or our affiliates are unable to access sufficient funding or enforce\\ncontractual relationships with respect to management and control of such business. In addition, the\\nPRC\\u2019s laws and regulations, as they apply to our business operations in Mainland China, have resulted\\nin modifications to our products and services in Mainland China. For example, the PRC government\\nhas laws and regulations that govern the dissemination of content over the Internet, and it may enact\\nadditional laws or regulations in the future related to content, privacy, security and government access\\nto personal information in a way that may materially impact our ability to conduct operations in the\\nPRC. Failure to comply with these requirements may mean that we will not obtain or retain necessary\\nlicenses to operate all or some of our services in Mainland China, or result in the blocking of our\\nservices in Mainland China. In addition, our compliance with these rules could harm our business,\\nreputation and brand outside of China. We will need to allocate significant resources to developing our\\npresence in China, and we may not be successful in doing so.\\n\\nOur business depends on a strong and trusted brand, and any failure to maintain, protect and\\nenhance our brand would hurt our ability to retain or expand our base of members, enterprises\\nand professional organizations, our ability to increase their level of engagement and our ability\\nto attract and retain high level employees.\\n\\nWe have developed a strong and trusted brand that we believe has contributed significantly to the\\nsuccess of our member network and business. Our brand is predicated on the idea that individual\\nprofessionals will trust us and find immense value in building and maintaining their professional\\nidentities and reputations on our platform, as well as investing in their professional learning and\\nknowledge. Maintaining, protecting and enhancing the \\u2018\\u2018LinkedIn\\u2019\\u2019 brand and our other key brands is\\ncritical to expanding our base of members, enterprises, advertisers, corporate customers and other\\npartners, and increasing their engagement with our services, and will depend largely on our ability to\\nmaintain member trust, be a technology leader and continue to provide valuable and high-quality\\nsolutions, which we may not do successfully. Despite our efforts to protect our brands and prevent\\nmisuse, if others misuse our brands or pass themselves off as being endorsed or affiliated with us, it\\ncould harm our reputation and our business could suffer. If our members or potential members\\ndetermine that they can use other platforms, such as social networks, for the same purposes as or as\\na replacement for our network, or if they choose to blend their professional and social networking\\nactivities, our brand and our business could be harmed. Our members or customers could find that new\\nproducts or features that we introduce are difficult to use or may feel that they degrade their\\nexperience with online service offered by LinkedIn, which could harm our reputation for delivering\\nhigh-quality products. Our brand is also important in attracting and maintaining high performing\\nemployees. If we do not successfully maintain a strong and trusted brand, our business could be\\nharmed.\\n\\n33\\n\\n\\n\\nWe may not be able to halt the operations of online services that aggregate our data as well as\\ndata from other companies, including social networks, or copycat online services that have\\nmisappropriated our data in the past or may misappropriate our data in the future. These\\nactivities could harm our brand and our business.\\n\\nFrom time to time, third parties have accessed data from our networks through scraping, robots or\\nother means and used this data or aggregated this data on their online services with other data. In\\naddition, \\u2018\\u2018copycat\\u2019\\u2019 online services have misappropriated data on our network and attempted to imitate\\nour brand or the functionality of our services, and these services or others could use similar tactics to\\ndevelop products that compete with ours. These activities could degrade our brand, negatively impact\\nour website performance and harm our business. When we have become aware of such online\\nservices, in many instances we have employed contractual, technological or legal measures in an\\nattempt to halt unauthorized activities, but these measures may not be successful. In addition, if our\\ncustomers do not comply with our terms of service, they also may be able to abuse our products and\\nservices and provide access to our solutions to unauthorized users. However, we may not be able to\\ndetect any or all of these types of activities in a timely manner and, even if we could, technological and\\nlegal measures may be insufficient to stop their operations. In some cases, particularly in the case of\\nonline services operating from outside of the United States, our available legal remedies may not be\\nadequate to protect our business against such activities. Regardless of whether we can successfully\\nenforce our rights against these parties, any measures that we may take could require us to expend\\nsignificant financial or other resources.\\n\\nFailure to protect or enforce our intellectual property rights could harm our business and\\noperating results.\\n\\nWe regard the protection of our trade secrets, copyrights, trademarks, trade dress, databases,\\ndomain names and patents as critical to our success. We strive to protect our intellectual property\\nrights by relying on federal, state and common law rights and other rights provided under foreign laws.\\nThese laws are subject to change at any time and could further restrict our ability to protect our\\nintellectual property rights. In addition, the existing laws of certain foreign countries in which we operate\\nmay not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as do the laws of the United States.\\nWe also have a practice of entering into confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with our\\nemployees and contractors, and often enter into confidentiality agreements with parties with whom we\\nconduct business in order to limit access to, and disclosure and use of, our proprietary information. In\\naddition, from time to time we make our intellectual property rights available to others under license\\nagreements. However, these contractual arrangements and the other steps we have taken to protect\\nour intellectual property rights may not prevent the misappropriation of our proprietary information,\\ninfringement of our intellectual property rights or deter independent development of similar or competing\\ntechnologies by others and may not provide an adequate remedy in the event of such misappropriation\\nor infringement.\\n\\nObtaining and maintaining effective intellectual property rights is expensive, including the costs of\\ndefending our rights. We are seeking to protect our trademarks and patents, and other intellectual\\nproperty rights in a number of jurisdictions, a process that is expensive and may not be successful in\\nall jurisdictions for every such right. Even where we have such rights, they may later be found to be\\nunenforceable or have a limited scope of enforceability. In addition, we may not seek to pursue such\\nprotection in every location. In particular, we believe it is important to maintain, protect and enhance\\nour brands. Accordingly, we pursue the registration of domain names and our trademarks and service\\nmarks in the United States and in many locations outside the United States. We have already and may,\\nover time, increase our investment in protecting innovations through investments in patents and similar\\nrights, and this process is expensive and time-consuming.\\n\\n34\\n\\n\\n\\nLitigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights, protect our proprietary rights\\nor determine the validity and scope of proprietary rights claimed by others. Any litigation of this nature,\\nregardless of outcome or merit, could result in substantial costs and diversion of management and\\ntechnical resources, any of which could adversely affect our business and operating results. We may\\nalso incur significant costs in enforcing our trademarks against those who attempt to imitate our\\n\\u2018\\u2018LinkedIn\\u2019\\u2019 brand and other valuable trademarks and service marks.\\n\\nIn addition, we have chosen to make certain of our technology available under open source\\nlicenses that allow others to use the technology without payment to us. While we hope to benefit from\\nthese activities by having access to others\\u2019 useful technology under open source licenses, there is no\\nassurance that we will receive the business benefits we expect.\\n\\nIf we fail to maintain, protect and enhance our intellectual property rights, our business and\\noperating results may be harmed, and the market price of our Class A common stock could decline.\\n\\nWe are, and expect in the future to be, subject to legal proceedings and litigation, including\\nintellectual property and privacy disputes, which are costly to defend and could materially harm\\nour business and operating results.\\n\\nWe are party to lawsuits and legal proceedings in the normal course of business. These matters\\nare often expensive and disruptive to normal business operations. We are currently facing, or may face\\nin the future, allegations, lawsuits and regulatory inquiries, audits and investigations regarding data\\nprivacy, security, labor and employment, consumer protection, the Fair Credit Reporting Act and\\nintellectual property infringement, including claims related to privacy, patents, publicity, trademarks,\\ncopyrights and other rights. We may also face allegations or litigation related to our acquisitions,\\nsecurities issuances or our business practices, including public disclosures about our business.\\nLitigation and regulatory proceedings, and particularly the patent infringement and class action matters\\nwe are facing or may face, may be protracted and expensive, and the results are difficult to predict.\\nCertain of these matters include speculative claims for substantial or indeterminate amounts of\\ndamages, and include claims for injunctive relief. Additionally, our litigation costs can be significant.\\nAdverse outcomes with respect to litigation or any of these legal proceedings may result in significant\\nsettlement costs or judgments, penalties and fines, or require us to modify our products and features or\\nrequire us to stop offering certain features, all of which could negatively impact our membership and\\nrevenue growth. Additionally, we are subject to periodic audits, which would likely increase our\\nregulatory compliance costs, and may require us to change our business practices, which could\\nnegatively impact our revenue growth. Managing legal proceedings, litigation and audits, even if we\\nachieve favorable outcomes, is time-consuming and diverts management\\u2019s attention from our business.\\n\\nIn addition, we use open source software in our solutions and plan to continue to use open source\\nsoftware in the future. The terms of many open source licenses have not been interpreted by United\\nStates or other courts, and these licenses could be construed in a manner that imposes unanticipated\\nconditions or restrictions on our ability to commercialize our products. We may face claims from others\\nclaiming ownership of open source software or patents related to that software, or breach of open\\nsource license terms, including a demand for release of material portions of our source code or\\notherwise seeking to enforce the terms of the applicable open source license. These claims could also\\nresult in litigation, which could be costly to defend, require us to purchase a costly license, require us\\nto establish additional specific open source compliance procedures, or require us to devote additional\\nresearch and development resources to remove open source elements from or otherwise change our\\nsolutions, any of which would have a negative effect on our business and operating results. In addition,\\nif we were to combine our own software with open source software in a certain manner, we could,\\nunder certain open source licenses, be required to release the source code of some software that\\nwould be valuable to keep as a trade secret and/or not make available for use by others which would\\nhave a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.\\n\\n35\\n\\n\\n\\nThe results of regulatory proceedings, litigation, claims and audits cannot be predicted with\\ncertainty, and determining reserves for pending litigation and other legal, regulatory and audit matters\\nrequires significant judgment. There can be no assurance that our expectations will prove correct, and\\neven if these matters are not resolved in our favor or without significant cash settlements, these\\nmatters, and the time and resources necessary to litigate or, resolve them, could harm our business,\\nour operating results, our reputation or the market price of our Class A common stock.\\n\\nBecause we recognize most of the revenue from our Talent Solutions and our Premium\\nSubscriptions over the term of the agreement, a significant downturn in these businesses may\\nnot be immediately reflected in our operating results.\\n\\nWe recognize most of the revenue from sales of our Talent Solutions and Premium Subscriptions\\n(which include Sales Solutions) over the terms of the agreements, which is typically 12 months. As a\\nresult, a significant portion of the revenue we report in each quarter is generated from agreements\\nentered into during previous quarters. Consequently, a decline in new or renewed agreements in any\\none quarter may not significantly impact our revenue in that quarter but will negatively affect our\\nrevenue in future quarters. In addition, we may be unable to adjust our fixed costs in response to\\nreduced revenue. Accordingly, the effect of significant declines in the sales of these offerings may not\\nbe reflected in our short-term results of operations.\\n\\nThe effectiveness of our Marketing Solutions depends in part on our relationships with\\nadvertising serving technology companies and the continued use of display advertising.\\n\\nWe do and will rely, in part, on advertising serving technology companies to deliver our Marketing\\nSolutions product. We may not be successful in entering into agreements on advantageous terms, our\\nexisting agreements with these companies may not be extended or renewed after their respective\\nexpirations, or we may not be able to extend or renew our agreements on terms and conditions\\nfavorable to us. If these agreements are terminated, we may not be able to enter into agreements with\\nalternative companies on acceptable terms or on a timely basis or both, which could negatively impact\\nrevenue from our Marketing Solutions. In addition, the use of display advertising is declining and we\\nface challenges coping with ad blocking technologies that have been developed and are likely to\\ncontinue to be developed that can block the display of advertisements.\\n\\nEnterprises or professional organizations, including governmental agencies, may restrict access\\nto our services, which could lead to the loss or slowing of growth in our member base or the\\nlevel of member engagement.\\n\\nOur solutions depend on the ability of our members to access the Internet and our services.\\nEnterprises or professional organizations, including governmental agencies, could block or restrict\\naccess to our online services, website or the Internet generally for a number of reasons such as\\nsecurity or confidentiality concerns or regulatory reasons, or they may adopt policies that prohibit listing\\nthe employers\\u2019 names on the employees\\u2019 LinkedIn profiles in order to minimize the risk that employees\\nwill be contacted and hired by other employers.\\n\\nIn some cases, certain governments may seek to restrict the Internet or our service providers\\u2019\\nwebsites, services and solutions and the performance of our websites, services and solutions could be\\nsuspended, blocked (in whole or part) or otherwise adversely impacted in these jurisdictions. For\\nexample, the government of the People\\u2019s Republic of China has blocked access to many social\\nnetworking and other sites (including ours for a brief period), and certain self-regulatory organizations\\nhave policies that could result in access to our content, services or features being blocked. Any\\nrestrictions on the use of our services by our members and users could lead to the loss or slowing of\\ngrowth in our member base or the level of member engagement.\\n\\n36\\n\\n\\n\\nIf Internet search engines\\u2019 methodologies are modified or our search result page rankings\\ndecline for other reasons, our member and non-member engagement could decline.\\n\\nWe depend in part on various Internet search engines to direct a significant amount of traffic to our\\nwebsite. Similarly, we depend on providers of mobile application \\u2018\\u2018store fronts\\u2019\\u2019 to allow users to locate\\nand download our mobile applications that enable our service. Our ability to maintain the number of\\nvisitors directed to our website and users of our online services is not entirely within our control. Our\\ncompetitors\\u2019 search engine optimization, or SEO, efforts may result in their websites receiving a higher\\nsearch result page ranking than ours, or Internet search engines could revise their methodologies in an\\nattempt to improve their search results, which could adversely affect the placement of our search result\\npage ranking. If search engine companies modify their search algorithms in ways that are detrimental\\nto our new user growth or in ways that make it harder for our members to use our website, or if our\\ncompetitors\\u2019 SEO efforts are more successful than ours, overall growth in our member base could slow,\\nmember and non-member engagement could decrease, and we could lose existing members. These\\nmodifications may be prompted by search engine companies entering the online professional\\nnetworking market or aligning with competitors. Our website has experienced fluctuations in search\\nresult rankings in the past, and we anticipate similar fluctuations in the future. Any reduction in the\\nnumber of users directed to our websites would harm our business and operating results.\\n\\nOur business depends on continued and unimpeded access to the Internet and mobile networks\\nby us and our members on personal computers and mobile devices. If government regulations\\nrelating to the Internet or mobile networks or other areas of our business change, if Internet\\naccess providers are able to block, degrade, or charge for access to certain of our products and\\nservices, or if third parties disrupt access to the Internet, we could incur additional expenses\\nand the loss of members and customers.\\n\\nOur products and services depend on the ability of our members and customers to access our\\nonline services through their personal computers and mobile devices. Currently, this access is provided\\nby companies that have significant market power in the broadband and Internet access marketplace,\\nincluding incumbent telephone companies, cable companies, mobile communications companies, and\\ngovernment-owned service providers, any of whom could take actions that degrade, disrupt, or increase\\nthe cost of user access to our products or solutions, which would, in turn, negatively impact our\\nbusiness. In addition, Internet or network access could be disrupted by other third parties. Further, the\\nadoption of any laws or regulations that adversely affect the growth, popularity or use of the Internet\\nand mobile networks, including laws limiting Internet neutrality, could decrease the demand for our\\nsubscription service or the usage of our services and increase our cost of doing business.\\n\\nOur growth depends in part on the success of our strategic relationships with third parties.\\n\\nWe anticipate that we will continue to depend on relationships with various third parties, including\\naccess to platforms and content providers and distributors to grow our business, authors who provide\\ncontent (including learning and development material), and channel partners. Identifying, negotiating\\nand maintaining relationships with third parties require significant time and resources, as does\\nintegrating third-party content and technology. Our agreements with technology and content providers\\nand similar third parties are typically non-exclusive and do not prohibit them from working with our\\ncompetitors or from offering competing services. In some cases, in particular, with respect to content\\nproviders, these relationships are undocumented, or, if there are agreements in place, they may be\\neasily terminable. Our competitors may be effective in providing incentives to these parties to favor\\ntheir solutions or may prevent us from developing strategic relationships with these parties. These third\\nparties may decide that working with LinkedIn is not in their interest. In addition, these third parties may\\nnot perform as expected under our agreements with them, and we have had, and may in the future\\nhave, disagreements or disputes with these parties, which could negatively affect our brand and\\n\\n37\\n\\n\\n\\nreputation. It is possible that these third parties may not be able to devote the resources we expect to\\nthe relationship or they may terminate their relationships with us. Further, as users increasingly access\\nour services through mobile devices, we are becoming more dependent on the distribution of our\\nmobile applications through third parties, and we may not be able to access their application program\\ninterfaces or be able to distribute our applications or provide ease of integration, and this may also\\nimpact our ability to monetize our mobile products. If we are unsuccessful in establishing or maintaining\\nour relationships with third parties, our ability to compete in the marketplace or to grow our business\\ncould be impaired, and our operating results would suffer. Even if we are successful, these\\nrelationships may not result in improved operating results.\\n\\nIf currency exchange rates fluctuate substantially in the future, the results of our operations,\\nwhich are reported in US dollars, could be adversely affected.\\n\\nAs we continue to expand our international operations, we become more exposed to the effects of\\nfluctuations in currency exchange rates. We incur expenses for employee compensation and other\\noperating expenses at our non-US locations in the local currency, and accept payment from customers\\nin currencies other than the US dollar. Since we conduct business in currencies other than US dollars\\nbut report our financial results in US dollars, we face exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange\\nrates. Consequently, exchange rate fluctuations between the US dollar and other currencies could have\\na material impact on our profitability, and because we recognize revenue over time, exchange rate\\nfluctuations at one point in time may have a negative impact in future quarters. Although we hedge a\\nportion of our foreign currency exposure, significant fluctuations in exchange rates between the US\\ndollar and foreign currencies may adversely affect our net income (loss). Additionally, hedging\\nprograms rely on our ability to forecast accurately and could expose us to additional risks that could\\nadversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\\n\\nThe intended tax efficiency of our corporate structure and intercompany arrangements depend\\non the interpretation and application of the tax laws of various jurisdictions and on how we\\noperate our business, and changes to our effective tax rate could adversely impact our results.\\n\\nOur corporate structure and intercompany arrangements, including the manner in which we\\ndevelop and use our intellectual property and the transfer pricing of our intercompany transactions, are\\nintended to optimize business efficiency as well as reduce our worldwide effective tax rate. The\\napplication of the tax laws of various jurisdictions, including the United States and the other jurisdictions\\nin which we operate, to our international business activities is subject to interpretation and depends on\\nour ability to operate our business in a manner consistent with our corporate structure and\\nintercompany arrangements. The taxing authorities of the jurisdictions in which we operate may\\nchallenge our methodologies for valuing developed technology or for transfer pricing on intercompany\\narrangements. In particular, our non-US headquarters is located in Dublin, Ireland, but tax authorities in\\nother jurisdictions where we operate may make a determination that the manner in which we operate\\nresults in our business not achieving the intended tax consequences. This could increase our\\nworldwide effective tax rate and harm our financial position and results of operations. Our effective tax\\nrate could be adversely affected by several other factors, many of which are outside of our control,\\nsuch as: increases in expenses that are not deductible for tax purposes, the tax effects of restructuring\\ncharges or purchase accounting for acquisitions, increases in withholding taxes, changes related to our\\nability to ultimately realize future benefits attributed to our deferred tax assets, including those related\\nto other-than-temporary impairment, and a change in our decision to indefinitely reinvest foreign\\nearnings. Further, we are currently undergoing review and audit by both domestic and foreign tax\\nauthorities and expect such actions to continue in the future. Any adverse outcome of such a review or\\naudit could have a negative effect on our operating results and financial condition.\\n\\n38\\n\\n\\n\\nThe enactment of legislation implementing changes in the US taxation of international business\\nactivities, the adoption of other tax reform policies or changes in tax legislation or policies in\\njurisdictions outside the United States could materially impact our financial position and results\\nof operations.\\n\\nPossible future changes to US tax laws, including limitations on the ability of taxpayers to claim\\nand utilize foreign tax credits and the deferral of certain tax deductions until earnings outside of the\\nUnited States are repatriated to the United States, as well as changes to US tax laws that may be\\nenacted in the future, could impact the tax treatment of our foreign earnings and adversely impact our\\neffective tax rate. Due to the large and expanding scale of our international business activities, any\\nchanges in the US or international taxation of such activities may increase our worldwide effective tax\\nrate and harm our financial position and results of operations.\\n\\nThe tax authorities in Ireland have announced changes to the treatment of non-resident Irish\\nentities, commonly used in a \\u2018\\u2018double Irish\\u2019\\u2019 structure. The changes will impact newly created Irish\\nentities immediately but are not expected to impact existing non-resident Irish entities, such as ours,\\nuntil after December 31, 2020. These changes may adversely impact our effective tax rate and harm\\nour financial position and results of operations. The United Kingdom has also recently enacted new tax\\nlegislation, and Australia has proposed new tax legislation, on diverted profits which may ultimately\\nimpact our foreign tax liability and negatively impact our effective tax rate and results of operations.\\n\\nAdditionally, the Organisation for Economic Co-Operation and Development recently released final\\nguidance covering various topics, including addressing the \\u2018\\u2018tax challenges of the digital economy,\\u2019\\u2019\\ncountry-by-country reporting, and definitional changes to permanent establishment, which could\\nultimately impact our tax liabilities to foreign jurisdictions and treatment of our foreign earnings from a\\nUS perspective which may adversely impact our effective tax rate and harm our financial position and\\nresults of operations.\\n\\nWe may require additional capital to support business growth, and this capital might not be\\navailable on acceptable terms, if at all.\\n\\nWe intend to continue to make investments to support our business growth and may require\\nadditional funds to respond to business challenges, including the need to develop new features and\\nproducts or enhance our existing solutions, improve our operating infrastructure or acquire\\ncomplementary businesses and technologies. Accordingly, we have engaged and may continue to\\nengage in equity or debt financings to secure additional funds. If we raise additional funds through\\nfuture issuances of equity or convertible debt securities, our existing stockholders could suffer\\nsignificant dilution, and any new equity securities we issue could have rights, preferences and\\nprivileges superior to those of holders of our Class A common stock. Any debt financing we secure in\\nthe future could involve restrictive covenants relating to our capital raising activities and other financial\\nand operational matters, which may make it more difficult for us to obtain additional capital and to\\npursue business opportunities, including potential acquisitions. We may not be able to obtain additional\\nfinancing on terms favorable to us, if at all. If we are unable to obtain adequate financing or financing\\non terms satisfactory to us when we require it, our ability to continue to support our business growth\\nand to respond to business challenges could be significantly impaired, and our business may be\\nharmed.\\n\\nAcquisitions and investments could result in operating difficulties, dilution, and other harmful\\nconsequences that may adversely impact our business and results of operations.\\n\\nWe have made and will continue to make acquisitions to add employees, complementary\\ncompanies, products, technologies or revenue. These transactions could be material to our financial\\ncondition and results of operations. We also expect to continue to evaluate and enter into discussions\\n\\n39\\n\\n\\n\\nregarding a wide array of potential strategic transactions. The identification of suitable acquisition\\ncandidates can be difficult, time-consuming and costly, and we may not be able to complete\\nacquisitions on favorable terms, if at all. The process of integrating an acquired company, business, or\\ntechnology has created, and will continue to create, unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures.\\nThe areas where we face risks include:\\n\\n\\u2022 loss of key employees of the acquired company and other challenges associated with integrating\\nnew employees into our culture, as well as reputational harm if integration is not successful;\\n\\n\\u2022 diversion of management time and focus from operating our business to acquisition integration\\nchallenges;\\n\\n\\u2022 implementation or remediation of controls, procedures, and policies at the acquired company;\\n\\n\\u2022 integration of the acquired company\\u2019s accounting, human resource, and other administrative\\nsystems, and coordination of product, engineering, and sales and marketing function;\\n\\n\\u2022 assumption of contractual obligations that contain terms that are not beneficial to us, require us\\nto license or waive intellectual property rights or increase our risk for liability;\\n\\n\\u2022 failure to successfully further develop the acquired technology;\\n\\n\\u2022 difficulty of transitioning the acquired technology onto our existing platforms and maintaining the\\nsecurity standards for such technology consistent with our other services;\\n\\n\\u2022 failure to successfully onboard customers or maintain brand quality of acquired companies;\\n\\n\\u2022 liability for activities of the acquired company before the acquisition, including patent and\\ntrademark infringement claims, violations of laws, commercial disputes, tax liabilities, and other\\nknown and unknown liabilities;\\n\\n\\u2022 failure to generate the expected financial results related to an acquisition on a timely manner or\\nat all; and\\n\\n\\u2022 failure to accurately forecast the impact of an acquisition transaction.\\n\\nThese risks or other problems encountered in connection with our acquisitions and investments\\ncould cause us to fail to realize the anticipated benefits of such acquisitions or investments, incur\\nunanticipated liabilities, and adversely affect our business generally.\\n\\nFuture acquisitions could also result in dilutive issuances of our equity securities, the incurrence of\\ndebt, contingent liabilities, amortization expenses, or write-offs of goodwill, any of which could harm our\\nfinancial condition. In addition, any acquisitions we announce could be viewed negatively by users,\\nmarketers, developers or investors.\\n\\nRisks Related to Our Class A Common Stock\\n\\nThe dual class structure of our common stock as contained in our charter documents has the\\neffect of concentrating voting control with those stockholders who held our stock prior to our\\ninitial public offering, including our founders and our executive officers, employees and\\ndirectors and their affiliates, and limiting our other stockholders\\u2019 ability to influence corporate\\nmatters.\\n\\nOur Class B common stock has 10 votes per share, and our Class A common stock has one vote\\nper share. Stockholders who hold shares of our Class B common stock, including our founders, and\\nour executive officers, employees and directors and their affiliates, together held approximately 57.2%\\nof the voting power of our outstanding capital stock as of December 31, 2015. Our co-founder and\\nChair, Reid Hoffman, held approximately 11.0% of the outstanding shares of our Class A and Class B\\n\\n40\\n\\n\\n\\ncommon stock, representing approximately 53.2% of the voting power of our outstanding capital stock\\nas of December 31, 2015. Mr. Hoffman has significant influence over the management and affairs of\\nthe company and over all matters requiring stockholder approval, including election of directors and\\nsignificant corporate transactions, such as a merger or other sale of our company or its assets.\\nMr. Hoffman will continue to have significant influence over these matters in the future.\\n\\nIn addition, the holders of our Class B common stock collectively will continue to be able to control\\nall matters submitted to our stockholders for approval even though their stock holdings represent less\\nthan 50% of the outstanding shares of our common stock. Because of the 10-to-1 voting ratio between\\nour Class B and Class A common stock, the holders of our Class B common stock collectively will\\ncontinue to control a majority of the combined voting power of our common stock even when the\\nshares of Class B common stock represent as little as 10% of the combined voting power of all\\noutstanding shares of our Class A and Class B common stock. This concentrated control will limit the\\nability of our Class A stockholders to influence corporate matters for the foreseeable future, and, as a\\nresult, the market price of our Class A common stock could be adversely affected.\\n\\nIf Mr. Hoffman continues to retain a significant portion of his holdings of Class B common stock for\\nan extended period of time, he could continue to control a majority of the combined voting power of our\\nClass A and Class B common stock. As a board member, Mr. Hoffman owes a fiduciary duty to our\\nstockholders and must act in good faith in a manner he reasonably believes to be in the best interests\\nof our stockholders. As a stockholder, even a controlling stockholder, Mr. Hoffman is entitled to vote his\\nshares in his own interests, which may not always be in the interests of our stockholders generally.\\n\\nOur stock price has been volatile in the past and may be subject to volatility in the future.\\n\\nThe trading price of our Class A common stock has been volatile historically, and could be subject\\nto wide fluctuations in response to various factors, some of which are beyond our control. During 2015,\\nthe closing price of our Class A common stock ranged from $169.94 to $270.76, and during 2016 to\\ndate, the closing price has been as low as $100.98. Fluctuations in the valuation of companies\\nperceived by investors to be comparable to us or in valuation metrics, such as our price to earnings\\nratio, could impact our stock price. Additionally, the stock markets have at times experienced extreme\\nprice and volume fluctuations that have affected and might in the future affect the market prices of\\nequity securities of many companies. These fluctuations have, in some cases, been unrelated or\\ndisproportionate to the operating performance of these companies. Further, the trading prices of\\npublicly traded shares of companies in our industry have been particularly volatile and may be very\\nvolatile in the future. These broad market and industry fluctuations, as well as general economic,\\npolitical and market conditions such as recessions, interest rate changes, international currency\\nfluctuations or political unrest, may negatively impact the market price of our Class A common stock. In\\naddition, our stock price may fluctuate based on whether our performance or guidance as to our future\\nperformance meets the expectations of our investors or securities analysts. Volatility in our stock price\\nalso impacts the value of our equity compensation, which affects our ability to recruit and retain\\nemployees. We may incur additional cash expense in connection with recruiting and retention costs,\\nand we may also experience increased dilution because of the need to provide more equity as part of\\nour overall compensation packages. In addition, some companies that have experienced volatility in the\\nmarket price of their stock have been subject to securities class action litigation. We may be the target\\nof this type of litigation in the future. Securities litigation against us could result in substantial costs and\\ndivert our management\\u2019s attention from other business concerns, which could harm our business.\\n\\n41\\n\\n\\n\\nAnti-takeover provisions in our charter documents and under Delaware law could make an\\nacquisition of us more difficult, limit attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our\\ncurrent management and limit the market price of our Class A common stock.\\n\\nProvisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated\\nbylaws, may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control or changes in our\\nmanagement. Our certificate of incorporation and bylaws include provisions that:\\n\\n\\u2022 authorize our board of directors to issue, without further action by the stockholders, up to\\n100,000,000 shares of undesignated preferred stock;\\n\\n\\u2022 require that any action to be taken by our stockholders be effected at a duly called annual or\\nspecial meeting and not by written consent;\\n\\n\\u2022 specify that special meetings of our stockholders can be called only by our board of directors,\\nthe Chair of our board of directors, or our Chief Executive Officer;\\n\\n\\u2022 establish an advance notice procedure for stockholder proposals to be brought before an annual\\nmeeting, including proposed nominations of persons for election to our board of directors;\\n\\n\\u2022 establish that our board of directors is divided into three classes, Class I, Class II and Class III,\\nwith each class serving three-year staggered terms;\\n\\n\\u2022 prohibit cumulative voting in the election of directors;\\n\\n\\u2022 provide that our directors may be removed only for cause;\\n\\n\\u2022 provide that vacancies on our board of directors may be filled only by a majority of directors then\\nin office, even though less than a quorum;\\n\\n\\u2022 require the approval of our board of directors or the holders of a supermajority of our\\noutstanding shares of capital stock to amend our bylaws and certain provisions of our certificate\\nof incorporation; and\\n\\n\\u2022 reflect two classes of common stock, as discussed above.\\n\\nThese provisions may frustrate or prevent any attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove\\nour current management by making it more difficult for stockholders to replace members of our board\\nof directors, which is responsible for appointing the members of our management. Provisions in the\\nindenture related to our convertible debt may also deter or prevent a business combination. In addition,\\ninstitutional shareholder representative groups, shareholder activists and others may disagree with our\\ncorporate governance provisions or other practices, including our dual class structure and the other\\nanti-takeover provisions, such as those listed above. We generally will consider recommendations of\\ninstitutional shareholder representative groups, but we will make decisions based on what our board\\nand management believe to be in the best long term interests of our company and stockholders. Our\\ndual class structure concentrates the voting power of our stock in a small group of stockholders who\\nwould have the ability to control the outcome of a stockholder vote. Additionally, these groups could\\nmake recommendations to our stockholders against our practices or our board members if they\\ndisagree with our positions. Finally, because we are incorporated in Delaware, we are governed by the\\nprovisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which generally prohibits a\\nDelaware corporation from engaging in any of a broad range of business combinations with any\\n\\u2018\\u2018interested\\u2019\\u2019 stockholder for a period of three years following the date on which the stockholder became\\nan \\u2018\\u2018interested\\u2019\\u2019 stockholder.\\n\\n42\\n\\n\\n\\nIf securities or industry analysts publish reports that are interpreted negatively by the\\ninvestment community or publish negative research reports about our business, our share price\\nand trading volume could decline.\\n\\nThe trading market for our Class A common stock depends, to some extent, on the research and\\nreports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or our business. We do not have any\\ncontrol over these analysts or the information contained in their reports. If one or more analysts publish\\nresearch reports that are interpreted negatively by the investment community, or have a negative tone\\nregarding our business, financial or operating performance, industry or end-markets, our share price\\ncould decline. In addition, if a majority of these analysts cease coverage of our company or fail to\\nregularly publish reports on us, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which could cause our\\nshare price or trading volume to decline.\\n\\nWe do not intend to pay dividends for the foreseeable future.\\n\\nWe have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our common stock and do not intend to\\npay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. We anticipate that we will retain all of our future\\nearnings for use in the development of our business and for general corporate purposes. Any\\ndetermination to pay dividends in the future will be at the discretion of our board of directors.\\nAccordingly, investors must rely on sales of their Class A common stock after price appreciation, which\\nmay never occur, as the only way to realize any future gains on their investments.\\n\\nRisks Related to our Convertible Notes\\n\\nServicing our convertible notes may require a significant amount of cash, and we may not have\\nsufficient cash flow or the ability to raise the funds necessary to satisfy our obligations under\\nthe convertible notes, and our future debt may contain limitations on our ability to pay cash\\nupon conversion or repurchase of the convertible notes.\\n\\nIn November 2014, we issued approximately $1.3 billion aggregate principal amount of 0.50%\\nconvertible senior notes due 2019 (the \\u2018\\u2018Notes\\u2019\\u2019). As of December 31, 2015, we had a total par value of\\napproximately $1.3 billion of outstanding Notes. Holders of the Notes will have the right to require us to\\nrepurchase all or a portion of their notes upon the occurrence of a fundamental change before the\\nrelevant maturity date, in each case at a repurchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the\\nNotes, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the fundamental change repurchase date. In\\naddition, upon conversion of the Notes, unless we elect to deliver solely shares of our common stock to\\nsettle such conversion (other than paying cash in lieu of delivering any fractional shares), we will be\\nrequired to make cash payments in respect of the Notes being converted. Moreover, we will be\\nrequired to repay the Notes in cash at their maturity, unless earlier converted or repurchased.\\n\\nOur ability to make cash payments in connection with conversions of the Notes or repurchase the\\nNotes in the event of a fundamental change will depend on market conditions and our future\\nperformance, which is subject to economic, financial, competitive and other factors beyond our control.\\nWe also may not use the cash raised through the issuance of the Notes in an optimally productive and\\nprofitable manner. At the time we are required to make repurchases of the Notes being surrendered or\\nconverted at their maturity, we may not have enough available cash or be able to obtain financing to\\nrefinance the Notes on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Our level of indebtedness could\\nadversely affect our future operations by increasing our vulnerability to adverse changes in general\\neconomic and industry conditions by limiting or prohibiting our ability to obtain additional financing for\\nfuture capital expenditures, acquisitions and general corporate and other purposes. If we are unable to\\nmake cash payments upon conversion of the Notes we would be required to issue significant amounts\\nof our Class A common stock, which would be dilutive to existing stockholders. In addition, if we do not\\nhave sufficient cash to repurchase the Notes following a fundamental change, we would be in default\\n\\n43\\n\\n\\n\\nunder the terms of the Notes, which could seriously harm our business. The terms of the Notes do not\\nlimit the amount of future indebtedness we may incur and if we incur significantly more debt, this could\\nintensify the risks described above.\\n\\nThe conditional conversion feature of the Notes, if triggered, may adversely affect our financial\\ncondition and operating results.\\n\\nIn the event the conditional conversion feature of the Notes is triggered, holders of notes will be\\nentitled to convert the notes at any time during specified periods at their option. If one or more holders\\nelect to convert their Notes, unless we elect to satisfy our conversion obligation by delivering solely\\nshares of our common stock (other than paying cash in lieu of delivering any fractional share), we\\nwould be required to settle a portion or all of our conversion obligation through the payment of cash,\\nwhich could adversely affect our liquidity. In addition, even if holders do not elect to convert their Notes,\\nwe could be required under applicable accounting rules to reclassify all or a portion of the outstanding\\nprincipal of the Notes as a current rather than long-term liability, which would result in a material\\nreduction of our net working capital.\\n\\nNote hedge and warrant transactions we have entered into may affect the value of the Notes\\nand our common stock.\\n\\nConcurrently with the issuance of the Notes, we entered into note hedge transactions with certain\\nfinancial institutions, which we refer to as the \\u2018\\u2018option counterparties.\\u2019\\u2019 The note hedge transactions are\\nexpected to reduce the potential dilution upon any conversion of the Notes and/or offset any cash\\npayments we are required to make in excess of the principal amount of converted Notes, as the case\\nmay be. We also entered into warrant transactions with the option counterparties. However, the warrant\\ntransactions could separately have a dilutive effect to the extent that the market price per share of our\\ncommon stock exceeds $381.82.\\n\\nIn connection with establishing their initial hedge of the note hedge and warrant transactions, the\\noption counterparties or their respective affiliates have purchased shares of our common stock and/or\\nentered into various derivative transactions with respect to our common stock following the pricing of\\nthe Notes. In addition, the option counterparties or their respective affiliates may modify their hedge\\npositions by entering into or unwinding various derivatives contracts with respect to our common stock\\nand/or purchasing or selling our common stock or other securities of ours in secondary market\\ntransactions prior to the maturity of the Notes (and are likely to do so during any observation period\\nrelated to a conversion of Notes or following any repurchase of Notes by us on any fundamental\\nchange repurchase date or otherwise). This activity could cause or avoid an increase or a decrease in\\nthe market price of our common stock or the Notes.\\n\\nIn addition, if any such convertible note hedge and warrant transactions fail to become effective,\\nthe option counterparties or their respective affiliates may unwind their hedge positions with respect to\\nour common stock, which could adversely affect the value of our common stock and the value of the\\nNotes.\\n\\nWe are subject to counterparty risk with respect to the note hedge transactions.\\n\\nThe option counterparties are financial institutions or affiliates of financial institutions, and we will\\nbe subject to the risk that these option counterparties may default under the note hedge transactions.\\nOur exposure to the credit risk of the option counterparties will not be secured by any collateral. If one\\nor more of the option counterparties to one or more of our note hedge transactions becomes subject to\\ninsolvency proceedings, we will become an unsecured creditor in those proceedings with a claim equal\\nto our exposure at the time under those transactions. Our exposure will depend on many factors but,\\ngenerally, the increase in our exposure will be correlated to the increase in the market price of our\\n\\n44\\n\\n\\n\\ncommon stock and in the volatility of the market price of our common stock. In addition, upon a default\\nby one of the option counterparties, we may suffer adverse tax consequences and dilution with respect\\nto our common stock. We can provide no assurances as to the financial stability or viability of any of\\nthe option counterparties.\\n\\nItem 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments\\n\\nNone.\\n\\nItem 2. Properties\\n\\nOur headquarters is located in Mountain View, California, where we lease approximately\\n373,000 square feet of office space under a lease that expires in 2023. We also lease office space of\\napproximately 2,982,000 square feet in locations throughout the United States and approximately\\n893,000 square feet internationally, some of which is currently under construction. We own land in\\nMountain View, CA, Sunnyvale, CA, and Dublin, Ireland, where we are building or are planning to build\\nadditional office space to accommodate anticipated future growth. In addition, we operate data centers\\nin the United States and Singapore pursuant to various lease and co-location agreements.\\n\\nWe believe that our current facilities, both owned and leased, are adequate to meet our current\\nneeds. We intend to expand our facilities or add new facilities as we add employees and enter new\\ngeographic markets, and we believe that suitable additional or alternative space will be available as\\nneeded to accommodate ongoing operations and any such growth.\\n\\nItem 3. Legal Proceedings\\n\\nWe are subject to legal proceedings and litigation arising in the ordinary course of business,\\nincluding, but not limited to, certain pending patent and privacy matters, including class action lawsuits,\\nas well as inquiries, investigations, audits and other regulatory proceedings. Although occasional\\nadverse decisions or settlements may occur, we do not believe that the final disposition of any of these\\nmatters will have a material adverse effect on our business. Certain of these matters include\\nspeculative claims for substantial or indeterminate amounts of damages, and include claims for\\ninjunctive relief. Additionally, our litigation costs can be significant. Other regulatory matters could result\\nin fines and penalties being assessed against us, and we may become subject to mandatory periodic\\naudits, which would likely increase our regulatory compliance costs. Adverse results of litigation or\\nregulatory matters could also result in us being required to change our business practices, which could\\nnegatively impact our membership and revenue growth.\\n\\nWe record a liability when we believe that it is both probable that a loss has been incurred and the\\namount can be reasonably estimated. Periodically, we evaluate developments in our legal matters that\\ncould affect the amounts that have been previously accrued, if any, and make adjustments as\\nappropriate. Significant judgment is required to determine both likelihood of there being, and the\\nestimated amount of, a loss related to such matters, and our judgment may be incorrect. The outcome\\nof any proceeding is not determinable in advance. Until the final resolution of any such matters that we\\nmay be required to accrue for, we may be exposed to loss in excess of the amount accrued, and such\\namounts could be material.\\n\\nItem 4.

We define adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss), plus: provision for income taxes; other\\n(income) expense, net; depreciation and amortization; and stock-based compensation.\\n\\nWe include adjusted EBITDA in this Annual Report on Form 10-K because it is a key measure\\nused by our management and board of directors to understand and evaluate our core operating\\nperformance and trends, to prepare and approve our annual budget and to develop short- and\\nlong-term operational plans. In particular, the exclusion of certain expenses in calculating adjusted\\nEBITDA can provide a useful measure for period-to-period comparisons of our core business.\\nAdditionally, adjusted EBITDA is a key financial measure used by the compensation committee of our\\nboard of directors in connection with the payment of bonuses to our executive officers and employees.\\nAccordingly, we believe that adjusted EBITDA provides useful information to investors and others in\\nunderstanding and evaluating our operating results in the same manner as our management and board\\nof directors.\\n\\nOur use of adjusted EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider it in\\nisolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under US GAAP. Some of these\\nlimitations are:\\n\\n\\u2022 although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and\\namortized may have to be replaced in the future, and adjusted EBITDA does not reflect cash\\ncapital expenditure requirements for such replacements or for new capital expenditure\\nrequirements;\\n\\n49\\n\\n\\n\\n\\u2022 adjusted EBITDA does not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital\\nneeds;\\n\\n\\u2022 adjusted EBITDA does not consider the potentially dilutive impact of stock-based compensation;\\n\\n\\u2022 adjusted EBITDA does not reflect tax payments that may represent a reduction in cash available\\nto us; and\\n\\n\\u2022 other companies, including companies in our industry, may calculate adjusted EBITDA\\ndifferently, which reduces its usefulness as a comparative measure.\\n\\nBecause of these limitations, you should consider adjusted EBITDA alongside other financial\\nperformance measures, including various cash flow metrics, net income (loss) and our other US GAAP\\nresults.

All information presented herein is based on the Company\\u2019s fiscal\\ncalendar. Unless otherwise stated, references in this report to particular years or quarters refer to the\\nCompany\\u2019s fiscal years ended December 31 of the applicable year and the associated quarters of\\nthose fiscal years. The Company assumes no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking\\nstatements for any reason, except as required by law.\\n\\nOverview\\n\\nAs the world\\u2019s largest professional network on the Internet, we currently have over 400 million\\nmembers in over 200 countries and territories. LinkedIn\\u2019s value proposition for our members and\\ncustomers is simple: connect to opportunity. Members use our platform to stay connected and\\ninformed, advance their career, and work smarter. Ultimately, our vision is to create economic\\nopportunity for every member of the global workforce by building the world\\u2019s first economic graph, a\\ndigital representation of the global economy.\\n\\nOur focus is on delivering value to members in their professional lives. We believe creating\\nvalue for members strengthens the network effect of our platform and enables us to deliver products\\nthat create value to our customers. In 2015, we made progress against several long-term initiatives that\\ndeliver value to our members, specifically: geographic expansion, particularly in China; launching our\\nre-imagined flagship mobile app; improving the overall job seeking experience, including scaling the\\ntotal number of jobs on our platform; and focusing on our content strategy.\\n\\nAlso, in 2015, we acquired lynda.com, Inc. (\\u2018\\u2018Lynda.com\\u2019\\u2019), a privately-held online learning company\\nthat offers an extensive, high quality library of professional training videos and courses. We believe that\\nthe acquisition of Lynda.com further expands our content strategy, broadens our Talent Solutions\\nproduct portfolio, and helps us realize our vision of building the world\\u2019s first economic graph. The total\\npurchase price for all of the outstanding equity interests of Lynda.com was approximately $1.5 billion,\\nsubject to adjustment, in combination of approximately 52% cash and approximately 48% in our\\nClass A common stock.\\n\\nOur revenue comes from products that monetize the critical mass of our platform. We\\nbelieve by creating value for our members we can transform the way our customers hire, market, sell,\\nand learn on a global basis through our three product lines: Talent Solutions, Marketing Solutions, and\\nPremium Subscriptions. Our Talent Solutions include Hiring and Learning & Development (\\u2018\\u2018L&D\\u2019\\u2019).\\nHiring provides products to recruiters that enable them to attract, recruit, and hire talent. L&D, from our\\nacquisition of Lynda.com, provides subscriptions to enterprises and individuals to online education\\ncourses. Our Marketing Solutions enable enterprises and individuals to advertise to our member base\\nthrough relevant content. Our Premium Subscriptions (inclusive of Sales Solutions) enable\\nprofessionals to manage their professional identity, grow their network, and connect with talent, while\\nSales Navigator, our premium social selling solution, enables sales professionals to find leads and\\ngenerate sales.\\n\\n51\\n\\n\\n\\nWhile we experienced significant revenue growth in 2015 compared to 2014, we had\\nsignificant operating losses as a result of our long-term investment strategy. In 2015, our net\\nrevenue was $2,990.9 million, which represents an increase of 35% from 2014. Our net revenue\\nbenefited from increased sales of our core products, specifically Recruiter, Jobs, Sponsored Content,\\nand Sales Solutions as well as revenue from our recent acquisition of Lynda.com. In 2015, we had an\\noperating loss of $214.7 million driven by increases in headcount-related expenses of $636.2 million as\\nwe hired additional employees to support the growth in our business. We also had an increase of\\n$183.5 million in depreciation and amortization related to intangible assets from our acquisition of\\nLynda.com, build out of our data centers, leasehold improvements as we lease additional facilities to\\naccommodate our headcount growth, and capitalized website and internal-use software.\\n\\nWe expect our growth rate to continue to decrease over time. As our net revenue increases,\\nwe expect that our growth rate related to net revenue will continue to decrease over time. Also, given\\nthe large scale and critical mass of our network, we believe member and engagement growth, as\\nmeasured by our key metrics, will decelerate over time and that this may impact the growth of certain\\nportions of our business. Our future growth will depend, in part, on our ability to continue to increase\\nmember growth and engagement by creating value for members as well as strengthening our core\\nofferings on mobile and desktop devices and expanding our global presence, which we believe will\\nresult in increased sales of our Talent Solutions, Marketing Solutions, and Premium Subscriptions.\\n\\nOur long-term financial focus is on sustainable, long-term growth; however, in the near term\\nwe expect US GAAP operating losses as we continue to make investments in our business.\\nOur investments in 2016 will focus on the following themes: our core products within Talent Solutions,\\nMarketing Solutions, and Premium Subscriptions, the marketplace dynamics between members and\\ncustomers to create reciprocal value in our products, and intelligent growth by supporting our\\nlong-term financial objectives of sustainable revenue and earnings growth.\\n\\n\\u2022 Our Products. With respect to product development, we will continue to focus investment on\\nour member and customer value proposition: connect to opportunity.\\n\\n\\u2022 Members. We plan to continue to invest in our global member experience focusing on our\\nvalue propositions: helping members stay connected and informed, advance their careers,\\nand work smarter.\\n\\n\\u2022 Customers. We plan to invest in our core product development efforts to transform the way\\ncustomers hire, market, sell, and learn.\\n\\nIn addition, we expect to continue to invest in mobile across our product lines. Mobile is the\\nfastest growing channel for member engagement, growing at twice the rate of overall site traffic\\nwith mobile unique visiting members representing 54% of unique visiting members in 2015.\\n\\n\\u2022 Our Talent. We expect to expand our workforce in 2016, however, such expansion, specifically\\nrelated to our sales and product development teams, will be at a slower rate than in 2015. We\\nexpect that the increased headcount will result in an increase in related expenses, including\\nstock-based compensation expense and capital expenditures related to facilities. As of\\nDecember 31, 2015, we had 9,372 employees, which represented an increase of 36% compared\\nto the prior year end. Excluding the employees from our acquisition of Lynda.com, we would\\nhave had 8,797 employees, which represents an increase of 28% compared to 2014.\\n\\n\\u2022 Our Technology. We expect to continue to make significant capital expenditures to upgrade our\\ntechnology and network infrastructure to improve the ability of our website to handle expected\\nincreases in usage, to enable the release of new features and solutions, and to scale for future\\ngrowth. These investments are particularly focused on expanding our footprint of data centers.\\n\\n52\\n\\n\\n\\nAs a result of our investment philosophy, we expect to be in an operating loss on a consolidated\\nbasis under generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (\\u2018\\u2018US GAAP\\u2019\\u2019).\\n\\nKey Metrics\\n\\nWe regularly review a number of metrics, including the following key metrics, to evaluate our\\nbusiness, measure our performance, identify trends affecting our business, formulate financial\\nprojections, and make strategic decisions. In addition, we regularly review our key metrics to assess\\nwhether they are the best metrics available to us as the business environment we operate in changes.\\nFor example, as mobile traffic continues to represent a larger portion of member engagement on our\\nsite, the relevance of member page views as a metric decreases because a well-designed mobile\\napplication may reduce the number of clicks and pages a member touches. In the future, we may\\nconsider alternative metrics to member page views such as a metric that tracks the frequency of\\nengagement a member has with our site.\\n\\n\\u2022 Number of Registered Members. We define the number of registered members in our network\\nas the number of individual users who have created a member profile on LinkedIn.com as of the\\ndate of measurement. We believe the number of registered members is an indicator of the\\ngrowth of our network and our ability to receive the benefits of the network effects resulting from\\nsuch growth. Growth in our member base depends, in part, on our ability to successfully develop\\nand market our solutions to professionals who have not yet become members of our network.\\nMember growth will also be contingent on our ability to translate our offerings into additional\\nlanguages, create more localized products in certain key markets, and more broadly expand our\\nmember base internationally. We believe that a higher number of registered members will result\\nin increased sales of our Talent Solutions, Marketing Solutions, and Premium Subscriptions, as\\ncustomers will have access to a larger pool of professional talent. However, a higher number of\\nregistered members will not immediately increase sales, nor will a higher number of registered\\nmembers in a given region immediately increase sales in that region, as growth of sales and\\nmarketing activities generally takes more time to develop than membership growth.\\n\\nThe following table presents the number of registered members as of the periods presented by\\ngeographic region:\\n\\nDecember 31, December 31,\\n\\n2015 2014 % Change 2014 2013 % Change\\n\\n(in thousands) (in thousands)\\n\\nMembers by geographic region:\\nUnited States . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 125,142 111,422 12% 111,422 94,115 18%\\nOther Americas(1) . . . . . . . . . . . . . 70,020 59,658 17% 59,658 47,646 25%\\n\\nTotal Americas . . . . . . . . . . . . . 195,162 171,080 14% 171,080 141,761 21%\\nEMEA(2) . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 132,634 110,654 20% 110,654 85,656 29%\\nAPAC(3) . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 85,875 64,997 32% 64,997 49,425 32%\\n\\nTotal number of registered\\nmembers(4) . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 413,671 346,731 19% 346,731 276,842 25%\\n\\n(1) Canada, Latin America and South America\\n\\n(2) Europe, the Middle East and Africa (\\u2018\\u2018EMEA\\u2019\\u2019)\\n\\n(3) Asia-Pacific (\\u2018\\u2018APAC\\u2019\\u2019)\\n\\n(4) The number of registered members is higher than the number of actual members due to various\\nfactors. For more information, see \\u2018\\u2018Risk Factors\\u2014The number of our registered members is higher\\n\\n53\\n\\n\\n\\nthan the number of actual members and a substantial majority of our traffic is generated by a\\nminority of our members. Our business may be adversely impacted if we are unable to attract and\\nretain additional members who actively use our services.\\u2019\\u2019\\n\\nThe number of our registered members increased by 19% in 2015 compared to 2014, and by 25%\\nin 2014 compared to 2013. Over these same periods, the growth rate in our net revenue exceeded the\\ngrowth rate of our number of registered members. While growth in the number of registered members\\ncan be an indicator of expected revenue growth, it also informs our management\\u2019s decisions with\\nrespect to those areas of our business that will require further investment to support expected future\\nmembership growth. For example, as the number of registered members increases, we may need to\\nincrease our capital expenditures to improve our information technology infrastructure to maintain the\\neffectiveness of our solutions and the performance of our website and mobile applications for our\\nmembers.\\n\\n\\u2022 Unique Visiting Members. We define unique visiting members as the total number of members\\nwho have visited LinkedIn.com on desktop or have visited selected mobile applications offered\\nby LinkedIn.com on their mobile devices at least once during a month. We view unique visiting\\nmembers as a key indicator of whether we are delivering value to members by continuing to\\nimprove our product offerings as well as growth in our brand awareness among members.\\nHigher levels of member traffic contribute to building a larger pool of professional talent and a\\nricher data ecosystem, which is our key monetizable asset. We leverage these assets, both\\ndirectly and indirectly, to grow sales within Talent Solutions, Marketing Solutions, and Premium\\nSubscriptions. Continued growth in unique visiting members will be driven by growth in the\\nnumber of registered members, improvements to features and products that drive traffic to our\\nwebsite and mobile applications, and global expansion. This growth may be impacted by\\nbusiness decisions aligned with our long-term strategy in order to create a better member\\nexperience. For example, our decision to reduce the number of emails sent to members may\\nadversely impact the amount of member traffic to our site.\\n\\nThe following table presents the average monthly number of unique visiting members during the\\nperiods presented:\\n\\nYear Ended Year Ended\\nDecember 31, December 31,\\n\\n2015 2014 % Change 2014 2013 % Change\\n\\n(in thousands) (in thousands)\\n\\nUnique visiting members(1),(3) . . . . . . . . . . 98,452 87,222 13% 87,222 73,147 19%\\nMobile unique visiting members(2),(3) . . . . . 52,770 40,050 32% 40,050 26,521 51%\\n\\n(1) Members who have visited LinkedIn.com on their desktops and/or have visited selected mobile\\napplications offered by LinkedIn.com on their mobile devices.\\n\\n(2) Members who have visited selected mobile applications offered by LinkedIn.com on their mobile\\ndevices.\\n\\n(3) We track unique visiting members using internal tools, which are subject to various risks. For more\\ninformation, see \\u2018\\u2018Risk Factors\\u2014The tracking of certain of our performance metrics is done with\\ninternal tools and is not independently verified. Certain of our performance metrics are subject to\\ninherent challenges in measurement, and real or perceived inaccuracies in such metrics may harm\\nour reputation and negatively affect our business.\\u2019\\u2019\\n\\n54\\n\\n\\n\\n\\u2022 Member Page Views. We define page views as the total number of page views our members\\nview during the measurement period on LinkedIn.com for desktop and on selected mobile\\napplications offered by LinkedIn.com for mobile devices. Similar to unique visiting members, we\\nbelieve member page views is an indicator for gaining insight into whether our members are\\nderiving increased value from our solutions. However, as overall site traffic is increasingly\\ncoming from mobile, we expect this metric to become less meaningful over time, as a\\nwell-designed mobile application reduces the number of clicks and pages a user touches in\\norder to create a high quality mobile experience. For example, member page views may be\\nadversely impacted by our new mobile flagship app which streamlines the product by decreasing\\nthe number of page views necessary to navigate the app. Specifically, more intuitive tabbed\\nbrowsing replaces a dedicated navigation page, which creates more seamless interaction.\\nAdditionally, member page views may not capture all of the value that our members and other\\nusers derive from our solutions because part of the benefit of certain products and features is\\nthat the member does not need to visit our website to receive value from our platform. For\\nexample, members can respond to InMails they receive from other members without accessing\\ntheir LinkedIn account or our website.\\n\\nThe following table presents the number of member page views during the periods presented:\\n\\nYear Ended Year Ended\\nDecember 31, December 31,\\n\\n2015 2014 % Change 2014 2013 % Change\\n\\n(in millions) (in millions)\\n\\nMember page views(1),(2) . . . . . . . . . . . 143,464 109,110 31% 109,110 82,990 31%\\n\\n(1) These metrics include member page views on LinkedIn.com for desktop and selected mobile\\napplications offered by LinkedIn.com for mobile devices.\\n\\n(2) We track page views using internal tools, which are subject to various risks. For more information,\\nsee \\u2018\\u2018Risk Factors\\u2014The tracking of certain of our performance metrics is done with internal tools\\nand is not independently verified. Certain of our performance metrics are subject to inherent\\nchallenges in measurement, and real or perceived inaccuracies in such metrics may harm our\\nreputation and negatively affect our business.\\u2019\\u2019\\n\\n\\u2022 Number of LinkedIn Corporate Solutions Customers. We define the number of LinkedIn\\nCorporate Solutions (\\u2018\\u2018LCS\\u2019\\u2019) customers as the number of enterprises and professional\\norganizations that we have under active contracts for our LCS products as of the date of\\nmeasurement. Our LCS products include LinkedIn Recruiter, Job Slots, Recruitment Media, and\\nCareer Pages, which are all part of Hiring within Talent Solutions. LCS products do not include\\nLinkedIn Jobs Postings, Job Seeker subscriptions, or Recruiter Lite subscriptions. The number of\\nLCS customers can be an indicator of our market penetration in the online recruiting market and\\nthe value that our products bring to both large and small enterprises and professional\\norganizations. However, we do not use this metric to manage our business and we believe the\\nusefulness of this metric is limited. For example, the amount of revenue attributable to a\\nparticular customer can vary significantly, and therefore one large customer can be much more\\nsignificant than a large number of smaller customers. In addition, we recognize LCS product\\nrevenue ratably over the terms of the respective agreements, which are typically 12 months. As\\na result, a significant amount of the LCS product revenue is derived from the recognition of\\ndeferred revenue relating to contracts entered into during previous quarters. Consequently, new\\ncustomers in any single quarter will likely have a minor impact on our revenue for that quarter. In\\naddition, there has recently been a conscious business effort to direct certain field sales\\ncustomers to self-serve products, which is expected to be favorable to our business, but would\\nbe negatively reflected in our LCS customer count as self-serve customers are not included in\\n\\n55\\n\\n\\n\\nthis metric. We believe the number of LCS customers was more meaningful when we were a\\nless mature company with a smaller overall customer base. For the above reasons, we do not\\nintend on providing this metric in the future and will continue to consider disclosing other metrics\\nthat may promote a material understanding of our business.\\n\\nThe following table presents the number of LCS customers as of the periods presented:\\n\\nDecember 31, December 31,\\n\\n2015 2014 % Change 2014 2013 % Change\\n\\nLCS customers . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 42,987 33,271 29% 33,271 24,444 36%\\n\\n\\u2022 Sales Channel Mix. We sell our Talent Solutions, Marketing Solutions, and Sales Solutions\\n(included in Premium Subscriptions) offline through our field organization or online on our\\nwebsite. Since the launch of the new Sales Navigator and increasing investment in the Sales\\nSolutions field sales team, we expect that the portion of Premium Subscriptions revenue from\\nour field sales channel will continue to increase over time.\\n\\nOur field sales organization uses a direct sales force to solicit customers and agencies. This\\noffline channel is characterized by a longer sales cycle where price can be negotiated, higher\\nrelative average selling prices, longer contract terms, higher selling expenses, and a longer cash\\ncollection cycle compared to our online channel.\\n\\nOur online, or self-service, sales channel allows members to purchase solutions directly on our\\nwebsite. Members can purchase Premium Subscriptions as well as certain lower priced products\\nin our Talent Solutions and Marketing Solutions, such as Job Seeker subscriptions, Job\\nPostings, Recruiter Lite, and self-service advertising. This channel is characterized by lower\\naverage selling prices, availability of monthly contractual terms, lower selling costs, and a highly\\nliquid collection cycle.\\n\\nThe following table presents our net revenue by field sales and online sales:\\n\\nYear Ended December 31,\\n\\n2015 2014 2013\\n\\n($ in thousands)\\n\\nField sales . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . $1,864,553 62% $1,349,804 61% $ 891,458 58%\\nOnline sales . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 1,126,358 38% 868,963 39% 637,087 42%\\n\\nNet revenue . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . $2,990,911 100% $2,218,767 100% $1,528,545 100%\\n\\nAdjusted EBITDA\\n\\nTo provide investors with additional information regarding our financial results, we disclose\\nadjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure, within this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We define\\nadjusted EBITDA as net income (loss), plus: provision for income taxes; other (income) expense, net;\\ndepreciation and amortization; and stock-based compensation. The following table presents a\\nreconciliation of adjusted EBITDA to net income (loss), the most directly comparable US GAAP\\nfinancial measure.\\n\\nWe include adjusted EBITDA in this Annual Report on Form 10-K because it is a key measure\\nused by our management and board of directors to understand and evaluate our core operating\\nperformance and trends, to prepare and approve our annual budget and to develop short- and\\nlong-term operational plans. In particular, the exclusion of certain expenses in calculating adjusted\\nEBITDA can provide a useful measure for period-to-period comparisons of our core business.\\nAdditionally, adjusted EBITDA is a key financial measure used by the compensation committee of our\\nboard of directors in connection with the payment of bonuses to our executive officers and employees.\\n\\n56\\n\\n\\n\\nAccordingly, we believe that adjusted EBITDA provides useful information to investors and others in\\nunderstanding and evaluating our operating results in the same manner as our management and board\\nof directors.\\n\\nFor additional information on the limitations of adjusted EBITDA, see \\u2018\\u2018Adjusted EBITDA\\u2019\\u2019 in Item 6\\n\\u2018\\u2018Selected Financial Data\\u2019\\u2019 for more information.\\n\\nYear Ended December 31,\\n\\n2015 2014 2013\\n\\n(in thousands)\\n\\nReconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA:\\nNet income (loss) . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . $(164,761) $ (15,320) $ 26,769\\nProvision (benefit) for income taxes . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

The increase in Hiring revenue\\nwas driven by increased spending by existing customers as well as additional business from new\\ncustomers, compared to the prior year. Learning & Development consists of revenue from our recent\\nacquisition of Lynda.com.\\n\\nNet revenue from our Marketing Solutions increased $126.8 million primarily due to Sponsored\\nContent from our field sales and self-service channels, and to a lesser extent, revenue from products\\nrelated to our acquisition of Bizo, Inc. (\\u2018\\u2018Bizo\\u2019\\u2019), partially offset by weakness in demand for our display\\nadvertising products. Sponsored Content represented 48% of Marketing Solutions revenue in 2015, and\\nwe expect it to represent a larger percentage of Marketing Solutions revenue as we continue to shift to\\ncontent marketing and experience less demand for display advertising products. In addition, in 2016,\\nBizo-related product revenue will decline as we discontinue the standalone products and work to\\nmigrate the functionality from the Bizo-related products into our Sponsored Content platform, making\\nthe technology accessible to any Marketing Solutions customer.\\n\\nNet revenue from our Premium Subscriptions increased $95.9 million primarily due to the increase\\nin revenue from our Sales Solutions products, which include Sales Navigator. Our Sales Solutions\\nproducts continue to grow at a higher rate than our other Premium Subscription products as well as\\ncontinue to represent a larger percentage of total Premium Subscriptions revenue.

In\\naddition, the increase is a result of an increase in the number of premium subscribers due to a higher\\nnumber of members and member engagement. Specifically, the number of registered members is a\\nmeaningful metric in evaluating and understanding net revenue from our Premium Subscriptions\\nbecause an increase in the number of registered members has historically led to a proportionate\\nincrease in the number of premium subscribers.\\n\\nThe following table presents our net revenue by geographic region:\\n\\nYear Ended December 31, Year Ended December 31,\\n\\n2015 2014 % Change 2014 2013 % Change\\n\\n($ in thousands) ($ in thousands)\\n\\nNet revenue by geographic\\nregion:\\nUnited States . . . . . . . . . . $1,845,808 $1,333,978 38% $1,333,978 $ 942,122 42%\\nOther Americas(1) . . . . . . . 167,975 143,207 17% 143,207 109,672 31%\\n\\nTotal Americas . . . . . . . 2,013,783 1,477,185 36% 1,477,185 1,051,794 40%\\nEMEA(2) . . . . . . . . . . . . . 730,244 554,567 32% 554,567 358,244 55%\\nAPAC(3) . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 246,884 187,015 32% 187,015 118,507 58%\\n\\nTotal . . . . . . . . . . . . . . $2,990,911 $2,218,767 35% $2,218,767 $1,528,545 45%\\n\\n(1) Canada, Latin America and South America\\n\\n(2) Europe, the Middle East and Africa (\\u2018\\u2018EMEA\\u2019\\u2019)\\n\\n(3) Asia-Pacific (\\u2018\\u2018APAC\\u2019\\u2019)\\n\\nInternational revenue increased $260.3 million in 2015 compared to 2014, and $298.4 million in\\n2014 compared to 2013.

As\\na result, we may take a charge of approximately $100.0 million during 2016 as a result of establishing\\na valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets. We regularly assess the realizability of our\\ndeferred tax assets and establish a valuation allowance if it is more-likely-than-not that some portion of\\nthe deferred tax assets will not be realized. We weigh all available positive and negative evidence,\\nincluding earnings history and results of recent operations, scheduled reversals of deferred tax\\nliabilities, projected future taxable income, and tax planning strategies. Assumptions used to forecast\\nfuture taxable income often require significant judgment. More weight is given to objectively verifiable\\nevidence. In the event we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred\\ntax assets in the future, a valuation allowance will be established against deferred tax assets in the\\n\\n65\\n\\n\\n\\nperiod in which we make such determination. The need to establish a valuation allowance against\\ndeferred tax assets may cause greater volatility in our effective tax rate.

Foreign losses decreased compared to 2014\\nprimarily due to lower research and development expenses, which include costs charged to our\\ninternational subsidiaries by LinkedIn.\\n\\nIncome tax expense increased $24.1 million in 2014 compared to 2013. The effective tax rates as\\nof December 31, 2014 and December 31, 2013 were 149% and 46%, respectively. The increase in\\nyear-over-year effective tax rates was primarily due to increased foreign losses in 2014 for which\\ndeferred tax assets have not been recognized and the 2012 Federal Research and Experimentation\\ncredit, which was included in the 2013 tax benefit. The increase in foreign losses is due primarily to\\nresearch and development expenses growing at a faster rate than international revenue. International\\nresearch and development expenses include costs charged by LinkedIn Corporation pursuant to US\\nTreasury Regulations and guidelines from the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and\\nDevelopment (\\u2018\\u2018OECD\\u2019\\u2019).\\n\\nOn December 19, 2014, the President of the United States signed into law The Tax Increase\\nPrevention Act of 2014 (the \\u2018\\u20182014 Act\\u2019\\u2019). Under prior law, a taxpayer was entitled to a research tax\\ncredit for qualifying amounts paid or incurred on or before December 31, 2013. The 2014 Act extended\\nthe research credit for one year to December 31, 2014. The extension of the research credit was\\nretroactive and includes amounts paid or incurred after December 31, 2013. As a result of the\\nretroactive extension, we recognized a tax benefit of $15.1 million in the twelve months ended\\nDecember 31, 2014 for qualifying amounts incurred in 2014.\\n\\nOn December 18, 2015, the President of the United States signed into law The Protecting\\nAmericans from Tax Hikes (PATH) Act of 2015 (the \\u2018\\u20182015 Act\\u2019\\u2019). The 2015 act establishes a\\npermanent research tax credit for qualifying amounts paid or incurred after December 31, 2014. As a\\nresult of the enacted permanent credit, we recognized a tax benefit of $20.4 million in 2015 for\\nqualifying amounts incurred in 2015.\\n\\n66\\n\\n\\n\\nConsolidated Quarterly Results of Operations Data\\n\\nThe following tables set forth our unaudited quarterly consolidated statements of operations data\\nand our unaudited consolidated statements of operations data as a percentage of net revenue for each\\nof the eight quarters ended December 31, 2015.

The cash flow from operating activities\\nconsisted primarily of the changes in our operating assets and liabilities, with deferred revenue\\nincreasing $144.0 million and accounts payable and other liabilities increasing $100.9 million, partially\\noffset by an increase in accounts receivable of $149.5 million. The increase in our deferred revenue\\nand accounts payable and other liabilities was primarily due to increases in transaction volumes in\\n2015 compared to 2014. We had a net loss in 2015 of $164.8 million, which included non-cash stock-\\nbased compensation of $510.3 million, non-cash depreciation and amortization of $420.5 million and\\nnon-cash amortization of debt discount and issuance costs of $45.6 million.\\n\\nOperating activities provided $569.0 million of cash in 2014. The cash flow from operating activities\\nconsisted primarily of the changes in our operating assets and liabilities, with deferred revenue\\nincreasing $129.3 million and accounts payable and other liabilities increasing $150.0 million, partially\\noffset by an increase in accounts receivable of $137.6 million, and an increase in excess tax benefit\\nfrom stock-based compensation of $99.2 million, which is reclassified as a financing activity. The\\nincreases in our deferred revenue and accounts payable and other liabilities were primarily due to\\nincreases in transaction volumes in 2014 compared to 2013. We had net loss in 2014 of $15.3 million,\\nwhich included non-cash stock-based compensation of $319.1 million and non-cash depreciation and\\namortization of $236.9 million.\\n\\nOperating activities provided $436.5 million of cash in 2013. The cash flow from operating activities\\nconsisted primarily of the changes in our operating assets and liabilities, with deferred revenue\\nincreasing $134.5 million and accounts payable and other liabilities increasing $114.7 million, partially\\noffset by an increase in accounts receivable of $102.6 million, and an increase in excess tax benefit\\nfrom stock-based compensation of $43.8 million, which is reclassified as a financing activity. The\\nincreases in our deferred revenue and accounts payable and other liabilities were primarily due to\\nincreases in transaction volumes in 2013 compared to 2012. We had net income in 2013 of\\n$26.8 million, which included non-cash stock-based compensation of $193.9 million and non-cash\\ndepreciation and amortization of $134.5 million.\\n\\nInvesting Activities\\n\\nOur primary investing activities consisted of purchases of marketable securities, purchases of\\nproperty and equipment, as well as payments for acquisitions and intangible assets. We continued to\\ninvest in technology hardware to support our growth, software to support website functionality\\ndevelopment, website operations and our corporate infrastructure. Purchases of property and\\nequipment may vary from period to period due to the timing of the expansion of our operations. We\\nexpect our planned purchases of property and equipment for 2016 to increase in absolute dollars, but\\nbe consistent as a percentage of revenue compared to last year, and these may be impacted by the\\ntiming and extent of data center and facility expansions.\\n\\nIn 2015, we had net purchases of marketable securities of $386.4 million, purchases of property\\nand equipment of $507.2 million, which includes $58.1 million in purchases of land and buildings, and\\npayments for intangible assets and acquisitions, net of cash acquired, of $677.8 million. In 2014, we\\nhad net purchases of marketable securities of $1,472.3 million, purchases of property and equipment of\\n$547.6 million, which includes $178.7 million in purchases of land, and payments for intangible assets\\nand acquisitions, net of cash acquired, of $253.5 million. In 2013, we had net purchases of marketable\\nsecurities of $1,055.4 million, purchases of property and equipment of $278.0 million, and payments for\\nintangible assets and acquisitions, net of cash acquired, of $19.2 million.\\n\\n72\\n\\n\\n\\nFinancing Activities\\n\\nIn 2015, our financing activities consisted primarily of net proceeds from the issuance of common\\nstock from employee stock option exercises and stock purchase plan, as well as the excess tax benefit\\nfrom stock-based compensation. Additionally, we had repurchases of equity awards of $25.2 million,\\npartially offset by proceeds from our issuance of preferred shares in our joint venture of $20.0 million.\\n\\nIn 2014, we received net proceeds from our convertible senior notes issuance, after deducting\\ninitial purchasers\\u2019 discount and debt issuance costs, of approximately $1,305.4 million. Concurrently\\nwith the issuance of the Notes, we used approximately $248.0 million of the net proceeds of the\\noffering of the Notes to pay the cost of convertible note hedge transactions, which was partially offset\\nby $167.3 million in proceeds from warrants we sold. See Note 9, Convertible Senior Notes, of the\\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8 for additional information.\\n\\nIn 2013, we received net proceeds from our follow-on offering, net of underwriting discounts and\\ncommissions and other costs of $1,348.1 million in proceeds.\\n\\nWith the exception of the Notes issuance and the follow-on offering, our financing activities consist\\nprimarily of the excess tax benefit from stock-based compensation and the proceeds from the issuance\\nof common stock from employee stock option exercises and our employee stock purchase plan.\\n\\nOff Balance Sheet Arrangements\\n\\nIn the ordinary course of business, we provide standby letters of credit or other guarantee\\ninstruments to third parties primarily for facility leases. As of December 31, 2015, we had financial\\nguarantees of $50.2 million that were not recorded on our consolidated balance sheet that consisted of\\nstandby letters of credit and bank guarantees. We had no other off balance sheet arrangements as\\ndefined in Item 303(a)(4) of Regulation S-K.\\n\\nContractual Obligations\\n\\nOur principal obligations consist of our operating leases and 0.50% convertible senior notes. Our\\nheadquarters is located in Mountain View, California, where we lease approximately 373,000 square\\nfeet of office space under a lease that expires in 2023. We also lease office space of approximately\\n2,982,000 square feet in locations throughout the United States and approximately 893,000 square feet\\ninternationally. In addition, we have data centers in the United States and Singapore pursuant to\\nvarious lease and co-location agreements. We have several significant long-term purchase obligations\\noutstanding with third parties. We do not have any significant capital lease obligations. As of\\nDecember 31, 2015, the following table summarizes our contractual obligations and the effect such\\nobligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods:\\n\\nPayments Due by Period\\n\\nLess Than 1 - 3 3 - 5 More Than\\nTotal 1 Year Years Years 5 Years\\n\\n(in thousands)\\n\\nOperating lease obligations(1) . . . . . . . $2,033,614 $159,693 $363,788 $ 395,218 $1,114,915\\n0.50% convertible senior notes(2) . . . . $1,348,951 $ 6,613 $ 13,225 $1,329,113 $ \\u2014\\nPurchase obligations . . . . . . . . . . . . . $ 54,335 $ 35,231 $ 19,104 $ \\u2014 $ \\u2014\\n\\n(1) Represents gross operating lease obligations, excluding sublease income of $213.6 million to be\\nrecognized over the next 11 years, which primarily relates to sublease income for several buildings\\nwe lease in Sunnyvale, California.\\n\\n73\\n\\n\\n\\n(2) Represents the aggregate principal amount and related interest on our convertible senior notes.\\nSee Note 9, Convertible Senior Notes, of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\\nunder Item 8 for additional information.\\n\\nThe contractual commitment amounts in the table above are associated with agreements that are\\nenforceable and legally binding. Obligations under contracts that we can cancel without a significant\\npenalty are not included in the table above.\\n\\nContingent obligations arising from unrecognized tax benefits are not included in the contractual\\nobligations because it is expected that the unrecognized benefits would only result in an insignificant\\namount of cash payments.\\n\\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\\n\\nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with US GAAP. The preparation\\nof these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect\\nthe reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses, and related disclosures. We evaluate our\\nestimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. Our estimates are based on historical experience and\\nvarious other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Our actual\\nresults could differ from these estimates.\\n\\nWe believe that the assumptions and estimates associated with revenue recognition, stock-based\\ncompensation, the valuation of goodwill and intangible assets, website and internal-use software\\ndevelopment costs, leases, income taxes, and legal contingencies have the greatest potential impact\\non our consolidated financial statements. Therefore, we consider these to be our critical accounting\\npolicies and estimates. For further information on all of our significant accounting policies, see Note 1,\\nDescription of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, of the Notes to Consolidated\\nFinancial Statements under Item 8.\\n\\nRevenue Recognition\\n\\nA majority of our arrangements for Talent Solutions and Marketing Solutions include multiple\\ndeliverables. We allocate consideration at the inception of an arrangement to all deliverables based on\\nthe relative selling price method in accordance with the selling price hierarchy. The objective of the\\nhierarchy is to determine the price at which we would transact a sale if the service was sold on a\\nstand-alone basis and requires the use of: (i) vendor-specific objective evidence (\\u2018\\u2018VSOE\\u2019\\u2019), if available;\\n(ii) third-party evidence (\\u2018\\u2018TPE\\u2019\\u2019), if VSOE is not available; and (iii) best estimate of selling price\\n(\\u2018\\u2018BESP\\u2019\\u2019), if neither VSOE nor TPE is available.\\n\\nVSOE. We determine VSOE based on our historical pricing and discounting practices for the\\nspecific solution when sold separately. In determining VSOE, we require that a substantial majority of\\nthe selling prices for these services fall within a reasonably narrow pricing range. We have established\\nVSOE for some of our Talent and Marketing Solutions products, and for such products VSOE has been\\nused to allocate the selling price of deliverables.\\n\\nTPE. When VSOE cannot be established for deliverables in multiple element arrangements, we\\napply judgment with respect to whether we can establish selling price based on TPE. TPE is\\ndetermined based on competitor prices for similar deliverables when sold separately. Generally, our\\ngo-to-market strategy differs from that of our peers and our offerings contain a significant level of\\ndifferentiation such that the comparable pricing of services with similar functionality cannot be obtained.\\nFurthermore, we are unable to reliably determine what similar competitor services\\u2019 selling prices are on\\na stand-alone basis. As a result, we have not been able to establish selling price based on TPE.\\n\\n74\\n\\n\\n\\nBESP. When we are unable to establish selling price using VSOE or TPE, we use BESP in our\\nallocation of arrangement consideration. The process for determining our BESP for deliverables without\\nVSOE or TPE involves management\\u2019s judgment. Our process considers multiple factors that may vary\\ndepending upon the unique facts and circumstances related to each deliverable. Key factors that we\\nconsidered in developing our BESPs include: (1) historical sales prices, (2) prices we charge for similar\\nofferings, (3) sales volume, and (4) geographies. Generally, we are not able to establish VSOE or TPE\\nfor our Talent Solutions and Marketing Solutions deliverables. The allocation of revenue has generally\\nbeen based on our BESPs.\\n\\nIf the facts and circumstances underlying the factors we considered change or should future facts\\nand circumstances lead us to consider additional factors, both our determination of our relative selling\\nprice under the hierarchy and our BESPs could change in future periods.\\n\\nValuation of Goodwill, Intangible Assets, and Other Derivative\\n\\nGoodwill and Intangible Assets. When we acquire businesses, we allocate the purchase price to\\nthe tangible assets, liabilities and identifiable intangible assets acquired. Any residual purchase price is\\nrecorded as goodwill. The allocation of the purchase price requires management to make significant\\nestimates in determining the fair value of acquired assets and assumed liabilities, especially with\\nrespect to intangible assets. These estimates are based on information obtained from management of\\nthe acquired companies, market participant data, and historical experience. These estimates can\\ninclude, but are not limited to:\\n\\n\\u2022 the time and expenses that would be necessary to recreate the asset;\\n\\n\\u2022 the profit margin a market participant would receive;\\n\\n\\u2022 cash flows that an asset is expected to generate in the future; and\\n\\n\\u2022 discount rates.\\n\\nThese estimates are inherently uncertain and unpredictable. A change in these estimates could\\nimpact our allocation of purchase price to the acquired assets and assumed liabilities. During the\\nmeasurement period, which is not to exceed one year from the acquisition date, we may record\\nadjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, with the corresponding offset to goodwill\\nbased on updated estimate information or facts and circumstances existing as of the acquisition date.\\nFollowing the earlier of 1) receipt of all necessary information to determine the fair value of assets\\nacquired and liabilities assumed, or 2) the conclusion of the measurement period, any subsequent\\nadjustments are recorded to earnings.\\n\\nOther Derivative. We have a derivative related to the embedded features on the preferred stock\\nof our joint venture, which is measured at fair value each reporting period. Management is required to\\nmake significant estimates to determine the inputs for the Black-Scholes option pricing model (\\u2018\\u2018OPM\\u2019\\u2019)\\nused to derive the valuation, which includes the enterprise value of the joint venture, volatility, and the\\nexpected term of when the embedded features will be exercised.\\n\\nThese estimates are inherently uncertain and unpredictable. The actual and projected performance\\nof the joint venture, volatility, and expected term of when the embedded features will be exercised may\\ndrive unpredictable changes in the valuation that could materially impact our financial results. Over the\\nlife of the derivative, the cumulative fair value adjustments in the consolidated statement of operations\\ncould be up to $155.0 million.\\n\\nWebsite and Internal-Use Software Development Costs\\n\\nWe capitalize certain costs related to the development of our website and mobile applications, or\\nsoftware developed for internal-use. We begin to capitalize our costs to develop software when\\n\\n75\\n\\n\\n\\nplanning stage efforts are successfully completed, management has authorized and committed project\\nfunding, and it is probable that the project will be completed and the software will be used as intended.\\nSuch costs are amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the related asset,\\ngenerally estimated to be two years. Costs incurred prior to meeting these criteria, together with costs\\nincurred for training and maintenance, are expensed as incurred and recorded within product\\ndevelopment expenses in our consolidated statements of operations. We exercise judgment in\\ndetermining the point at which various projects may be capitalized, in assessing the ongoing value of\\nthe capitalized costs, and in determining the estimated useful lives over which the costs are amortized.\\nTo the extent that we change the manner in which we develop and test new features and\\nfunctionalities related to our website and mobile applications, assess the ongoing value of capitalized\\nassets, or determine the estimated useful lives over which the costs are amortized, the amount of\\nwebsite and internal-use software development costs we capitalize and amortize could change in future\\nperiods.\\n\\nLeases\\n\\nFrom inception, all of our significant leases have been accounted for as operating leases.\\nAccounting for these leases requires significant judgment by management. Management determines\\nwhether leases are accounted for as a capital or operating lease, or whether we are considered the\\nowner for accounting purposes, based on an evaluation of the specific contractual lease terms in\\naccordance with the authoritative accounting guidance on leases.\\n\\nIf the lease is considered a capital lease or we are considered the owner for accounting purposes,\\nwe would record the property and a related capital lease obligation on our balance sheet. The asset\\nwould then be depreciated over the lease term. Rent payments for these properties would be allocated\\nbetween interest expense and a reduction of the capital lease obligation.\\n\\nIf the lease is considered an operating lease, it is not recorded on our balance sheet and rent\\nexpense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\\n\\nThe most significant estimates used by management in accounting for property leases and the\\nimpact of these estimates are as follows:\\n\\n\\u2022 Lease term. The lease term is used in determining whether the lease is accounted for as an\\noperating lease or a capital lease. A lease is considered a capital lease if the lease term is\\nequal to or exceeds 75% of the leased asset\\u2019s estimated economic life. The lease term is also\\nused in determining the depreciable life of the asset or the straight-line rent recognition period.\\nIncreasing the lease term will increase the probability that a lease will be considered a capital\\nlease and will generally result in higher rent expense for an operating lease and higher interest\\nand depreciation expenses for a capital lease.\\n\\n\\u2022 Incremental borrowing rate. The incremental borrowing rate is primarily used in determining\\nwhether the lease is accounted for as an operating lease or a capital lease. A lease is\\nconsidered a capital lease if the net present value of the lease payments is equal to or greater\\nthan 90% of the fair market value of the property. We utilize the incremental borrowing rate to\\ndiscount the gross value of the minimum lease payments related to a contractual lease\\nobligation. We estimate this rate by considering the effective yield on our existing convertible\\ndebt, interest swap rates comparable to the expected term of the lease payments and our credit\\nspread. Increasing the incremental borrowing rate decreases the net present value of the lease\\npayments.\\n\\n\\u2022 Fair market value of leased asset. The fair market value of leased property is generally\\nestimated based on comparable market data. Fair market value is used in determining whether\\nthe lease is accounted for as an operating lease or a capital lease.\\n\\n76\\n\\n\\n\\nIf our assumptions change and we amend an existing lease or enter into a new lease, we may\\nhave leases that are accounted for as capital leases, as well as operating leases. Accounting for a\\nlease as a capital lease would accelerate the timing of expense recognition due to the recognition of\\nlarger amounts of interest expense near the beginning of the lease term. It would also change the\\ncharacterization of expense from rent expense to a combination of depreciation and interest expense,\\nboth of which are excluded from our adjusted EBITDA metric and would likely impact other financial\\nmetrics. However, lease classification would not be expected to impact our cash flow.\\n\\nIncome Taxes\\n\\nWe record income taxes using the asset and liability method, which requires the recognition of\\ndeferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been\\nrecognized in our financial statements or tax returns. In estimating future tax consequences, generally\\nall expected future events other than enactments or changes in the tax law or rates are considered.\\nValuation allowances are provided when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount\\nexpected to be realized.\\n\\nWe recognize a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not the tax\\nposition will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the\\nposition. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such positions are then measured\\nbased on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon settlement.\\nIn the event that any unrecognized tax benefits are recognized, the effective tax rate will be affected. If\\nrecognized, approximately $43.2 million of unrecognized tax benefit would impact the effective tax rate\\nat December 31, 2015. Although we believe our estimates are reasonable, no assurance can be given\\nthat the final tax outcome of these matters will be the same as these estimates. These estimates are\\nupdated quarterly based on factors such as change in facts or circumstances, changes in tax law, new\\naudit activity, and effectively settled issues.\\n\\nWe regularly assess the realizability of our deferred tax assets and establish a valuation allowance\\nif it is more-likely-than-not that some portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. We weigh\\nall available positive and negative evidence, including earnings history and results of recent operations,\\nscheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, and tax planning\\nstrategies. Assumptions used to forecast future taxable income often require significant judgment. More\\nweight is given to objectively verifiable evidence. In the event we determine that it would not be able to\\nrealize all or part of our net deferred tax assets in the future, a valuation allowance will be established\\nagainst deferred tax assets in the period in which we make such determination. The need to establish\\na valuation allowance against deferred tax assets may cause greater volatility in our effective tax rate.\\nIt is reasonably possible that any such adjustment would materially change in the next 12 months. See\\nNote 15, Income Taxes, of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8 for\\nadditional information on our income taxes.\\n\\nLegal Contingencies\\n\\nWe are subject to legal proceedings and litigation arising in the ordinary course of business.\\nPeriodically, we evaluate the status of each legal matter and assess our potential financial exposure. If\\nthe potential loss from any legal proceeding or litigation is considered probable and the amount can be\\nreasonably estimated, we accrue a liability for the estimated loss. Significant judgment is required to\\ndetermine the probability of a loss and whether the amount of the loss is reasonably estimable. The\\noutcome of any proceeding is not determinable in advance. As a result, the assessment of a potential\\nliability and the amount of accruals recorded are based only on the information available at the time. As\\nadditional information becomes available, we reassess the potential liability related to the legal\\nproceeding or litigation, and may revise our estimates. Any revisions could have a material effect on\\nour results of operations. See Note 12, Commitments and Contingencies, of the Notes to the\\n\\n77\\n\\n\\n\\nConsolidated Financial Statements under Item 8 for additional information on our legal proceedings and\\nlitigation.\\n\\nStock-Based Compensation\\n\\nWe measure stock-based compensation at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and\\nrecognize expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period, which is generally the\\nvesting period of the award.\\n\\nStock-based compensation expense is recorded net of estimated forfeitures. On a quarterly basis,\\nwe estimate the forfeiture rate based on our historical experience and adjust the rate to reflect changes\\nin facts and circumstances, if any. We revise our estimated forfeiture rate if actual forfeitures differ from\\nour initial estimates, which may cause fluctuations in our stock-based compensation in the period of\\nchange.\\n\\nDetermining the fair value of stock-based awards at the grant date requires judgment. We use the\\nBlack-Scholes option-pricing model to determine the fair value of stock options and our employee stock\\npurchase plan (\\u2018\\u2018ESPP\\u2019\\u2019) awards. The determination of the grant date fair value using an option-pricing\\nmodel is affected by the market value of our common stock as well as assumptions regarding a\\nnumber of other complex and subjective variables. These variables include our expected stock price\\nvolatility, the expected term of the awards, risk-free interest rates, and expected dividends.\\n\\nRecently Issued Accounting Guidance\\n\\nSee Note 1, Description of Business and Basis of Presentation, of the Notes to Consolidated\\nFinancial Statements under Item 8 for recently issued accounting guidance.\\n\\nItem 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure About Market Risk\\n\\nWe have operations both within the United States and internationally, and we are exposed to\\nmarket risks in the ordinary course of our business. These risks include primarily interest rate, foreign\\nexchange risks, and inflation.\\n\\nInterest Rate Fluctuation Risk\\n\\nWe had cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities of $3,119.4 million and $3,443.3 million\\nas of December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. This amount was invested primarily in money market\\nfunds and highly liquid investment grade fixed income securities. The cash, cash equivalents and\\nmarketable securities are held for working capital purposes. Our investment policy and strategy is\\nfocused on the preservation of capital and supporting our liquidity requirements. We do not enter into\\ninvestments for trading or speculative purposes. At December 31, 2015, the weighted-average duration\\nof our investment portfolio was less than one year.\\n\\nOur fixed-income portfolio is subject to fluctuations in interest rates, which could affect our results\\nof operations. Based on our investment portfolio balance as of December 31, 2015, a hypothetical\\nincrease in interest rates of 1% (100 basis points) would have resulted in a decrease in the fair value\\nof our portfolio of approximately $19.8 million, and a hypothetical increase of 0.5% (50 basis points)\\nwould have resulted in a decrease in the fair value of our portfolio of approximately $9.9 million.\\n\\nForeign Currency Exchange Risks\\n\\nWe have foreign currency exchange risks related to our revenue and operating expenses\\ndenominated in currencies other than the US dollar, principally the Euro, the British Pound Sterling, the\\nAustralian dollar, and the Canadian dollar. The volatility of exchange rates depends on many factors\\nthat we cannot forecast with reliable accuracy. We have experienced and will continue to experience\\n\\n78\\n\\n\\n\\nfluctuations in foreign exchange gains (losses) related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates.\\nIn the event our foreign currency denominated assets, liabilities, sales or expenses increase, our\\noperating results may be more greatly affected by fluctuations in the exchange rates of the currencies\\nin which we do business.\\n\\nWe enter into foreign currency derivative contracts to reduce the risk that our cash flows and\\nearnings will be adversely affected by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations.\\n\\nCash Flow Hedges\\n\\nWe use foreign currency derivative contracts designated as cash flow hedges to hedge forecasted\\nrevenue transactions denominated in currencies other than the US dollar. Our cash flow hedges are\\ncarried at fair value with gains or losses initially recorded as a component of accumulated other\\ncomprehensive income (loss) in stockholders\\u2019 equity and subsequently reclassified into revenue when\\nthe underlying hedged revenue is recognized.\\n\\nBalance Sheet Hedges\\n\\nWe use other foreign currency derivative contracts not designated as hedging instruments\\n(\\u2018\\u2018balance sheet hedges\\u2019\\u2019) to reduce exchange rate risk associated with our foreign currency\\ndenominated monetary assets and liabilities. These balance sheet hedges are carried at fair value with\\nchanges in the fair value recorded to other income (expense), net in our consolidated statements of\\noperations. These contracts do not subject us to material financial statement risk due to exchange rate\\nmovements because gains and losses on these derivatives are intended to offset gains and losses on\\nthe hedged foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities.\\n\\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had outstanding foreign currency derivative contracts with a total\\nnotional amount of $561.5 million. If overall foreign currency exchange rates appreciated (depreciated)\\nuniformly by 5% against the US dollar, our foreign currency derivative contracts outstanding as of\\nDecember 31, 2015 would experience a loss (gain) of approximately $17.7 million.\\n\\nMarket Risk and Market Interest Risk\\n\\nOn November 12, 2014, we issued $1,322.5 million aggregate principal amount of 0.50%\\nconvertible senior notes (the \\u2018\\u2018Notes\\u2019\\u2019). Holders may convert their notes prior to maturity under certain\\ncircumstances. Upon conversion, we will pay or deliver, as the case may be, cash, shares of our\\nClass A common stock, or a combination of cash and shares of our Class A common stock, at our\\nelection. We intend to settle the principal and interest due on the Notes in cash. Concurrent with the\\nissuance of the Notes, we purchased options (\\u2018\\u2018Note Hedges\\u2019\\u2019) and sold warrants, in order to reduce\\nthe potential economic dilution upon conversion of the Notes.\\n\\nWe do not have economic interest rate exposure related to the Notes, as they have a fixed annual\\ninterest rate of 0.50%. We do, however, have interest rate risk because the fair value of our Notes will\\ngenerally increase when interest rates fall and decrease when interest rates rise. Additionally, the fair\\nvalue of our Notes may be impacted by price of our Class A common stock. As of December 31, 2015,\\nthe estimated fair value of our Notes was $1,382.0 million based on the closing trading price of the\\nNotes as of the last day of trading for the period. See Note 9, Convertible Senior Notes, under Item 8\\nfor additional information on the Notes, including the carrying value of the Notes.\\n\\nThe embedded features on the preferred stock of our joint venture are accounted for as a\\nderivative instrument, which is measured at fair value each reporting period. Management is required to\\nmake significant estimates to determine the fair value, and those estimates can be affected by market\\nvolatility. The financial impact to future periods will depend on changes in fair value of the derivative\\ninstruments, which is correlated with the performance and value of the Company\\u2019s joint venture, and\\n\\n79\\n\\n\\n\\nwill be recorded in Other income (expense), net. Over the life of the derivative, the cumulative fair\\nvalue adjustments in the consolidated statement of operations could be up to $155.0 million.\\n\\nInflation Risk\\n\\nWe do not believe that inflation has had a material effect on our business, financial condition or\\nresults of operations. If our costs were to become subject to significant inflationary pressures, we may\\nnot be able to fully offset such higher costs through price increases. Our inability or failure to do so\\ncould harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\\n\\n80\\n\\n\\n\\nItem 8.

These financial statements are the\\nresponsibility of the Company\\u2019s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these\\nfinancial statements based on our audits.\\n\\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting\\nOversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain\\nreasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An\\naudit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the\\nfinancial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant\\nestimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We\\nbelieve that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\\n\\nIn our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the\\nfinancial position of LinkedIn Corporation and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, and the\\nresults of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended\\nDecember 31, 2015, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of\\nAmerica.\\n\\nWe have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting\\nOversight Board (United States), the Company\\u2019s internal control over financial reporting as of\\nDecember 31, 2015, based on the criteria established in Internal Control\\u2014Integrated Framework (2013)\\nissued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report\\ndated February 11, 2016, expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company\\u2019s internal control over\\nfinancial reporting.\\n\\n/s/ DELOITTE & TOUCHE LLP\\n\\nSan Jose, California\\nFebruary 11, 2016\\n\\n82\\n\\n\\n\\nLINKEDIN CORPORATION\\n\\nCONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS\\n\\n(In thousands, except share data)\\n\\nDecember 31,\\n\\n2015 2014\\n\\nASSETS\\nCURRENT ASSETS:\\n\\nCash and cash equivalents . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . $ 546,237 $ 460,887\\nMarketable securities . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 2,573,145 2,982,422\\nAccounts receivable (net of allowance for doubtful accounts of $17,970 and\\n\\n$11,944 at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively) . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 603,060 449,048\\nDeferred commissions . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 87,706 66,561\\nPrepaid expenses . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 62,992 52,978\\nOther current assets . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 61,949 110,204\\n\\nTotal current assets . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 3,935,089 4,122,100\\nProperty and equipment, net . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 1,047,005 740,909\\nGoodwill . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 1,507,093 356,718\\nIntangible assets, net . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 373,087 131,275\\nOther assets . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 148,925 76,255\\n\\nTOTAL ASSETS . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . $7,011,199 $5,427,257\\n\\nLIABILITIES, REDEEMABLE NONCONTROLLING INTEREST, AND\\nSTOCKHOLDERS\\u2019 EQUITY\\n\\nCURRENT LIABILITIES:\\nAccounts payable . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . $ 162,176 $ 100,297\\nAccrued liabilities . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 316,792 260,189\\nDeferred revenue . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 709,116 522,299\\n\\nTotal current liabilities . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 1,188,084 882,785\\nCONVERTIBLE SENIOR NOTES, NET . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 1,126,534 1,081,553\\nOTHER LONG-TERM LIABILITIES . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 201,128 132,100\\n\\nTotal liabilities . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 2,515,746 2,096,438\\n\\nCOMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES (Note 12)\\nREDEEMABLE NONCONTROLLING INTEREST . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 26,810 5,427\\nSTOCKHOLDERS\\u2019 EQUITY (Note 13):\\n\\nClass A common stock, $0.0001 par value; 1,000,000,000 shares authorized,\\n117,500,405 and 116,468,385 shares issued and outstanding, respectively,\\nat December 31, 2015 and 110,291,709 and 109,259,689 shares issued and\\noutstanding, respectively, at December 31, 2014 . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 12 11\\n\\nClass B common stock, $0.0001 par value; 120,000,000 shares authorized,\\n15,580,510 and 15,782,261 shares issued and outstanding at December 31,\\n2015 and 2014, respectively . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 1 2\\n\\nAdditional paid-in capital . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 4,588,578 3,285,705\\nAccumulated other comprehensive income (loss) . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 9,124 (198)\\nAccumulated earnings (deficit) . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\\n\\nLinkedIn Corporation and its subsidiaries (the \\u2018\\u2018Company\\u2019\\u2019), a Delaware corporation, was\\nincorporated on March 6, 2003. The Company operates an online professional network on the Internet\\nthrough which the Company\\u2019s members are able to create, manage and share their professional\\nidentities, build and engage with their professional networks, access shared knowledge and insights,\\nand find business opportunities, enabling them to be more productive and successful. The Company\\nbelieves it is the most extensive, accurate, and accessible network focused on professionals.\\n\\nCertain Significant Risks and Uncertainties\\n\\nThe Company operates in a dynamic industry and, accordingly, can be affected by a variety of\\nfactors. For example, management of the Company believes that changes in any of the following areas\\ncould have a significant negative effect on the Company in terms of its future consolidated financial\\nposition, results of operations, or cash flows: scaling and adaptation of existing technology and network\\ninfrastructure; protection of customers\\u2019 information and privacy concerns; security measures related to\\nthe Company\\u2019s website; rates of revenue growth; engagement and usage of the Company\\u2019s solutions;\\nmanagement of the Company\\u2019s growth; new markets and international expansion; protection of the\\nCompany\\u2019s brand and intellectual property; competition in the Company\\u2019s market; qualified employees\\nand key personnel; intellectual property infringement and other claims; and changes in government\\nregulation affecting the Company\\u2019s business, among other things.\\n\\nPrinciples of Consolidation\\n\\nThe consolidated financial statements include the Company, its wholly-owned subsidiaries, and\\nvariable interest entities in which LinkedIn is the primary beneficiary in accordance with the\\nconsolidation accounting guidance. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.\\n\\nRedeemable noncontrolling interest (\\u2018\\u2018RNCI\\u2019\\u2019) is included in the consolidated balance sheets. RNCI\\nis considered to be temporary equity and is therefore reported outside of permanent equity equal to its\\nredemption value as of the balance sheet date.\\n\\nUse of Estimates\\n\\nThe preparation of the Company\\u2019s consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally\\naccepted accounting principles in the United States of America (\\u2018\\u2018US GAAP\\u2019\\u2019) requires management to\\nmake estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and\\ndisclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and\\nthe reported amounts of income and expenses during the reporting period. These estimates are based\\non information available as of the date of the consolidated financial statements; therefore, actual results\\ncould differ from management\\u2019s estimates.\\n\\nConcentrations of Credit Risk\\n\\nFinancial instruments, which potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk,\\nconsist primarily of cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities, derivatives, and accounts\\nreceivable. Although the Company deposits its cash with financial institutions that management\\nbelieves are of high credit quality, its deposits, at times, may exceed federally insured limits. The\\nCompany\\u2019s investment portfolio consists of investment grade securities diversified amongst security\\ntypes, industries, and issuers. The Company\\u2019s investment policy limits the amount of credit exposure in\\nthe investment portfolio to a maximum of 5% to any one issuer, except for its US treasury and agency\\nsecurities, and the Company believes no significant concentration risk exists with respect to these\\n\\n89\\n\\n\\n\\ninvestments. Foreign exchange contracts are transacted with various financial institutions with high\\ncredit standings.\\n\\nCredit risk with respect to accounts receivable is dispersed due to the large number of customers,\\nnone of which accounted for more than 10% of total accounts receivable as of December 31, 2015 and\\n2014. In addition, the Company\\u2019s credit risk is mitigated by the relatively short collection period. The\\nCompany records accounts receivable at the invoiced amount and does not charge interest. Collateral\\nis not required for accounts receivable. The Company\\u2019s allowance for doubtful accounts is based on\\nhistorical loss patterns, the number of days that billings are past due, and an evaluation of the potential\\nrisk of loss associated with delinquent accounts. The following table presents the changes in the\\nallowance for doubtful accounts (in thousands):\\n\\nYear Ended December 31,\\n\\n2015 2014 2013\\n\\nAllowance for doubtful accounts:\\nBalance, beginning of period . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . $11,944 $ 6,138 $ 3,774\\nAdd: bad debt expense . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 11,873 10,273 4,130\\nLess: write-offs, net of recoveries and other adjustments . . . . . . . . . .

For those\\nentities where the functional currency is the local currency, adjustments resulting from translating the\\nfinancial statements into US dollars are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive\\nincome (loss) in stockholders\\u2019 equity. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in a foreign currency\\nare translated into US dollars at the exchange rate on the balance sheet date. Revenue and expenses\\nare translated at the weighted average exchange rates during the period. Equity transactions are\\ntranslated using historical exchange rates. Foreign currency transaction gains and losses are included\\nin other income (expense), net in the consolidated statements of operations.\\n\\nCash Equivalents\\n\\nCash equivalents consist of highly liquid marketable securities with original maturities of three\\nmonths or less at the time of purchase and consist primarily of money market funds, commercial paper,\\nUS treasury securities and US agency securities. Cash equivalents are stated at fair value.\\n\\nMarketable Securities\\n\\nMarketable securities consist of commercial paper, certificates of deposit, US treasury securities,\\nUS agency securities, corporate debt securities, and municipal securities, and are classified as\\navailable-for-sale securities. As the Company views these securities as available to support current\\noperations, it has classified all available-for-sale securities as short term. Available-for-sale securities\\nare carried at fair value with unrealized gains and losses reported as a component of accumulated\\nother comprehensive income (loss) in stockholders\\u2019 equity, while realized gains and losses and\\nother-than-temporary impairments are reported as a component of net income (loss). An impairment\\ncharge is recorded in the consolidated statements of operations for declines in fair value below the cost\\nof an individual investment that are deemed to be other than temporary. The Company assesses\\nwhether a decline in value is temporary based on the length of time that the fair market value has been\\nbelow cost, the severity of the decline and the intent and ability to hold until recovery.\\n\\n90\\n\\n\\n\\nFair Value of Financial Instruments\\n\\nThe Company applies fair value accounting for all financial assets and liabilities and non-financial\\nassets and liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a\\nrecurring basis. Fair value is based on an expected exit price as defined by the authoritative guidance\\non fair value measurements, which represents the amount that would be received on the sale of an\\nasset or paid to transfer a liability, as the case may be, in an orderly transaction between market\\nparticipants. As such, fair value may be based on assumptions that market participants would use in\\npricing an asset or liability. The authoritative guidance on fair value measurements establishes a\\nconsistent framework for measuring fair value on either a recurring or nonrecurring basis whereby the\\ninputs used in valuation techniques are assigned a hierarchical level. The following are the hierarchical\\nlevels of inputs to measure fair value:\\n\\n\\u2022 Level 1: Observable inputs that reflect quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities\\nin active markets.\\n\\n\\u2022 Level 2: Inputs reflect: quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in markets that are not\\nactive; quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; inputs other than quoted\\nprices that are observable for the assets or liabilities; or inputs that are derived principally from\\nor corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means.\\n\\n\\u2022 Level 3: Unobservable inputs reflecting the Company\\u2019s assumptions incorporated in valuation\\ntechniques used to determine fair value. These assumptions are required to be consistent with\\nmarket participant assumptions that are reasonably available.\\n\\nSee Note 2, Fair Value Measurements, for information on the Company\\u2019s valuation techniques\\nused to measure fair value. The Company\\u2019s procedures include controls to ensure that appropriate fair\\nvalues are recorded, including comparing the fair values obtained from the Company\\u2019s pricing service\\nagainst fair values obtained from another independent source, incorporating transaction-specific details,\\nand assumptions about the Company\\u2019s joint venture performance that, in management\\u2019s judgment,\\nmarket participants would take into account in measuring fair value.\\n\\nDeferred Commissions\\n\\nDeferred commissions are the incremental costs that are directly associated with non-cancelable\\nsubscription contracts primarily related to sales of the Company\\u2019s Talent Solutions and Sales Solutions\\nproducts. Deferred commissions consist of sales commissions paid to the Company\\u2019s direct sales\\nrepresentatives and certain third-party agencies and are deferred and amortized over the\\nnon-cancelable terms of the related customer contracts, which are generally 12 months on average.\\nThe commission payments are generally paid in full in the month after the customer contract is signed.\\nThe deferred commission amounts are recoverable through future revenue streams under the\\nnon-cancelable customer contracts. The Company believes the commission charges are closely related\\nto the revenue from the non-cancelable customer contracts and, therefore, should be recorded as an\\nasset and charged to expense over the same period that the subscription revenue is recognized.\\nShort-term deferred commissions are included in deferred commissions and long-term deferred\\ncommissions are included in other assets in the consolidated balance sheets. The amortization of\\ndeferred commissions is included in sales and marketing expense in the consolidated statements of\\noperations.\\n\\nDerivative Financial Instruments\\n\\nThe Company has global operations and transacts business in multiple currencies, which exposes\\nit to foreign currency exchange risk. The Company enters into foreign currency derivative contracts with\\nfinancial institutions to reduce the risk that its cash flows and earnings will be adversely affected by\\n\\n91\\n\\n\\n\\nforeign currency exchange rate fluctuations. The Company\\u2019s program is not designated for trading or\\nspeculative purposes.\\n\\nThe foreign currency derivative contracts that were not settled as of December 31, 2015 and 2014\\nare recorded at fair value in the consolidated balance sheets. See Note 5, Derivative Instruments, for\\nadditional information.\\n\\nProperty and Equipment\\n\\nProperty and equipment are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is\\ncomputed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which range from\\ntwo to five years. Buildings represent construction in progress related to the construction or\\ndevelopment of property that has not yet been placed in service for its intended use. Buildings will be\\ndepreciated over a period of 40 years. Leasehold improvements are depreciated over the shorter of the\\nlease term or expected useful lives of the improvements. Depreciation expense totaled $285.8 million,\\n$202.3 million and $118.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013,\\nrespectively. Land is not depreciated.\\n\\nWebsite and Internal-Use Software Development Costs\\n\\nThe Company capitalizes certain costs to develop its website, mobile applications, and internal-use\\nsoftware when planning stage efforts are successfully completed, management has committed project\\nresourcing, and it is probable that the project will be completed and the software will be used as\\nintended. Such costs are amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the related\\nasset, which is generally two years. Costs incurred prior to meeting these criteria, together with costs\\nincurred for training and maintenance, are expensed as incurred.\\n\\nThe Company capitalized website and internal-use software development costs of $97.4 million,\\n$55.7 million and $39.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.\\nThe Company\\u2019s capitalized website and internal-use software depreciation is included in depreciation\\nand amortization in the Company\\u2019s consolidated statements of operations, and totaled $51.8 million,\\n$40.7 million and $15.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.\\nThe Company had unamortized capitalized website and internal-use software of $105.0 million and\\n$59.4 million in the consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.\\n\\nGoodwill, Intangible Assets, Long-Lived Assets, and Impairment Assessments\\n\\nGoodwill. Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price of an acquired business over the\\nfair value of the underlying net tangible and intangible assets. Goodwill is evaluated for impairment\\nannually in the third quarter of the Company\\u2019s fiscal year, and whenever events or changes in\\ncircumstances indicate the carrying value of goodwill may not be recoverable. Triggering events that\\nmay indicate impairment include, but are not limited to, a significant adverse change in member\\nengagement or business climate that could affect the value of goodwill or a significant decrease in\\nexpected cash flows. Since inception through December 31, 2015, the Company did not have any\\ngoodwill impairment.\\n\\nIntangible assets. Intangible assets consist of identifiable intangible assets, primarily customer\\nrelationships and developed technology as a result from the Company\\u2019s acquisitions. Intangible assets\\nacquired in a business combination are initially measured at fair value; other intangible assets are\\ninitially measured at cost. Thereafter, intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over their\\nestimated useful lives.\\n\\nLong-lived assets. The Company evaluates its long-lived assets, including property and\\nequipment and intangible assets, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate\\nthat the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held\\n\\n92\\n\\n\\n\\nand used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to future undiscounted net\\ncash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If such assets are considered to be impaired, the\\nimpairment to be recognized is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets\\nexceeds the fair value of the assets.\\n\\nLegal Contingencies\\n\\nThe Company is regularly subject to claims, lawsuits, investigations, and other proceedings that\\narise in the ordinary course of business. Certain of these matters include speculative claims for\\nsubstantial or indeterminate amounts of damages. The Company records a liability when it believes\\nthat it is both probable that a loss has been incurred, and the amount can be reasonably estimated.\\nSignificant judgment is required to determine both likelihood of there being and the estimated amount\\nof a loss related to such matters. The Company periodically evaluates developments in its legal matters\\nthat could affect the amount of liability that it has previously accrued, if any, and adjusts accordingly to\\nreflect the impact of negotiations, settlements, rulings, advice of legal counsel, and updated information.\\nUntil the final resolution of such matters, there may be an exposure to loss in excess of the amount\\nrecorded, and such amounts could be material. Any estimates and assumptions that change or prove\\nto have been incorrect could have a material impact on the Company\\u2019s business, consolidated financial\\nposition, results of operations, or cash flows.\\n\\nRevenue Recognition\\n\\nIn general, the Company recognizes revenue when (i) persuasive evidence of an arrangement\\nexists, (ii) delivery has occurred or services have been rendered to the customer, (iii) the fee is fixed or\\ndeterminable, and (iv) collectability is reasonably assured. Where arrangements have multiple\\nelements, revenue is allocated to the elements based on the relative selling price method and revenue\\nis recognized based on the Company\\u2019s policy for each respective element.\\n\\nThe Company generates revenue primarily from Talent Solutions, Marketing Solutions, and\\nPremium Subscriptions:\\n\\n\\u2022 Talent Solutions\\u2014Talent Solutions revenue is comprised of Hiring and Learning & Development\\nproducts. Hiring products primarily consist of LinkedIn Recruiter, Job Slots, Career Pages, Job\\nPostings, Job Seeker subscriptions, and Recruiter Lite subscriptions. The Company provides\\naccess to its professional database of both active and passive job candidates with LinkedIn\\nRecruiter, which allows corporate recruiting teams to identify candidates based on industry, job\\nfunction, geography, experience/education, and other specifications. Revenue from the LinkedIn\\nRecruiter product is recognized ratably over the subscription period, which consists primarily of\\nannual subscriptions that are billed monthly, quarterly, or annually. The Company also earns\\nrevenue from Job Slots, which enable an enterprise or professional organization to post jobs on\\nits website, and allows the job that is posted to be changed, updated or modified over the life of\\nthe contract. Revenue from Job Slots is recognized ratably over the contract, typically one year.\\nCareer Pages give enterprises and professional organizations the ability to customize the career\\nsection of their Company Profiles and content on Career Pages to allow potential candidates to\\nlearn more about what it is like to work at their company. Revenue from Career Pages is\\nrecognized ratably over the contractual period, which is typically 12 months. The Company also\\nearns revenue from the placement of Job Postings on its website, which generally runs for\\n30 days. Independent recruiters can pay to post job openings that are accessible through job\\nsearches or targeted job matches. Revenue from Job Postings is recognized as the posting is\\ndisplayed or at the expiration of the contract period, if not utilized. Job Seeker subscriptions give\\naccess to premium features on our website to help them find job opportunities. Revenue from\\nJob Seeker and Recruiter Lite subscriptions is also recognized ratably over the contractual\\nperiod, which consists of monthly and annual subscriptions. Learning & Development products\\n\\n93\\n\\n\\n\\nconsist of individual and enterprise subscriptions to the Lynda.com learning platform. Revenue\\nfrom these subscriptions is recognized ratably over the subscription period, which consists of\\nmonthly and annual subscriptions for individuals and annual and multi-year subscriptions for\\nenterprises.\\n\\n\\u2022 Marketing Solutions\\u2014Marketing Solutions revenue is earned from advertisements (consisting of\\ncontent-based, graphic display, and text link) shown primarily on LinkedIn.com and its mobile\\napplications based on either a cost per click or cost per advertisement model. Revenue from\\nInternet advertising is generally recognized on a gross basis, with the exception of transactions\\nwith advertising agencies, which are recognized net of agency discounts. As a result of the\\nCompany\\u2019s acquisition of Bizo in 2014, and the re-launch of its marketing solutions product\\nsuite, the Company also sells and recognizes a portion of revenue from off-network advertising.\\nThe typical duration of the Company\\u2019s advertising contracts is approximately two months.\\n\\n\\u2022 Premium Subscriptions\\u2014Premium Subscriptions revenue is derived primarily from selling various\\nsubscriptions to customers that allow users to have further access to premium services on\\nLinkedIn.com. The Company offers its members monthly or annual subscriptions. Revenue from\\nPremium Subscription services is recognized ratably over the contractual period, which is\\ngenerally from one to 12 months. The Company also includes revenue from its Sales Solutions\\nproducts in Premium Subscriptions, which includes annual subscription solutions sold through its\\nfield sales channel. Revenue from Sales Solution subscriptions is also recognized ratably over\\nthe contractual period, which is generally 12 months.\\n\\nAmounts billed or collected in excess of revenue recognized are included as deferred revenue.\\nSales tax is excluded from reported net revenue. Although historical refunds have been minimal, the\\nCompany estimates allowances by revenue type based on information available as of each balance\\nsheet date. This information includes historical refunds as well as specific known service quality issues.\\nThe Company records revenue for transactions in which it acts as an agent on a net basis, and\\nrevenue for transactions in which it acts as a principal on a gross basis.\\n\\nA majority of the Company\\u2019s arrangements for Talent Solutions and Marketing Solutions include\\nmultiple deliverables. The Company allocates consideration at the inception of an arrangement to all\\ndeliverables based on the relative selling price method in accordance with the selling price hierarchy.\\nThe objective of the hierarchy is to determine the price at which the Company would transact a sale if\\nthe service were sold on a stand-alone basis and requires the use of: (i) vendor-specific objective\\nevidence (\\u2018\\u2018VSOE\\u2019\\u2019) if available; (ii) third-party evidence (\\u2018\\u2018TPE\\u2019\\u2019) if VSOE is not available; and (iii) best\\nestimate of selling price (\\u2018\\u2018BESP\\u2019\\u2019) if neither VSOE nor TPE is available.\\n\\nVSOE. The Company determines VSOE based on its historical pricing and discounting practices\\nfor the specific product or service when sold separately. In determining VSOE, the Company requires\\nthat a substantial majority of the selling prices for these services fall within a reasonably narrow pricing\\nrange.\\n\\nThe Company has established VSOE for a limited number of Talent and Marketing Solutions\\nproducts, and for such products, VSOE has been used to allocate the selling price to deliverables.\\n\\nTPE. When VSOE cannot be established for deliverables in multiple element arrangements, the\\nCompany applies judgment with respect to whether it can establish a selling price based on TPE. TPE\\nis determined based on competitor prices for similar deliverables when sold separately. Generally, the\\nCompany\\u2019s go-to-market strategy differs from that of its peers and its offerings contain a significant\\nlevel of differentiation such that the comparable pricing of services with similar functionality cannot be\\nobtained. Furthermore, the Company is unable to reliably determine what similar competitor services\\u2019\\nselling prices are on a stand-alone basis. As a result, the Company has not been able to establish\\nselling prices based on TPE.\\n\\n94\\n\\n\\n\\nBESP. When the Company is unable to establish selling prices using VSOE or TPE, the\\nCompany uses BESP in its allocation of arrangement consideration. BESP is generally used to allocate\\nthe selling price to deliverables in the Company\\u2019s multiple element arrangements. The Company\\ndetermines BESP for deliverables by considering multiple factors including, but not limited to, its pricing\\npractices, prices it charges for similar offerings, sales volume, geographies, market conditions, and the\\ncompetitive landscape.\\n\\nAdvertising Costs\\n\\nAdvertising costs are expensed when incurred and are included in sales and marketing expense in\\nthe consolidated statements of operations. The Company incurred advertising costs of $20.0 million,\\n$5.7 million and $3.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.\\n\\nStock-Based Compensation\\n\\nStock-based compensation expense is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the\\naward and is recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period of the award, which is\\ngenerally four years. See Note 13, Stockholders\\u2019 Equity, for additional information.\\n\\nLeases and Asset Retirement Obligations\\n\\nThe Company leases its office facilities and data centers under operating lease agreements. Office\\nfacilities subject to an operating lease and the related lease payments are not recorded on the\\nCompany\\u2019s balance sheet. The terms of certain lease agreements provide for increasing rental\\npayments; however, the Company recognizes rent expense on a straight-line basis over the term of the\\nlease. Any lease incentives are recognized as reductions of rent expense on a straight-line basis over\\nthe term of the lease. The lease term begins on the date of the initial possession of the leased property\\nfor purposes of recognizing rent expense.\\n\\nThe Company establishes assets and liabilities for the contractual obligation to retire long-lived\\nassets at the termination or expiration of a lease based on the present value of estimated future costs\\nrelated to such obligations. Such assets are depreciated over the shorter of the lease period, or the life\\nof the asset, and the recorded liabilities are accreted to the future value of the estimated retirement\\ncosts, both of which are included in operating expenses in the consolidated statements of operations.\\n\\nRent expense, principally for leased office space and data centers under operating lease\\ncommitments, was $117.5 million, $94.2 million and $54.9 million for the years ended December 31,\\n2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.\\n\\nIncome Taxes\\n\\nThe Company records income taxes using the asset and liability method which requires the\\nrecognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that\\nhave been recognized in the Company\\u2019s consolidated financial statements or tax returns. In estimating\\nfuture tax consequences, generally all expected future events other than enactments or changes in the\\ntax law or rates are considered. Valuation allowances are provided when necessary to reduce deferred\\ntax assets to the amount expected to be realized.\\n\\nRecently Adopted Accounting Guidance\\n\\nDerivatives and Hedging\\n\\nIn November 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\\u2018\\u2018FASB\\u2019\\u2019) issued new authoritative\\naccounting guidance on determining whether the host contract in a hybrid financial instrument issued in\\nthe form of a share is more akin to debt or to equity. The guidance applies to hybrid financial\\ninstruments that include embedded derivative features, which must be evaluated to determine whether\\n\\n95\\n\\n\\n\\nthe nature of the host contract is more akin to debt or to equity and whether the economic\\ncharacteristics and risks of the embedded derivative feature are clearly and closely related to the host\\ncontract. If the host contract is akin to equity, then equity-like features (for example, a conversion\\noption) are considered clearly and closely related to the host contract and, thus, would not be\\nseparated from the host contract. If the host contract is akin to debt, then equity-like features are not\\nconsidered clearly and closely related to the host contract. In the latter case, an entity may be required\\nto separate the equity-like embedded derivative feature from the debt host contract if certain other\\ncriteria are met. Similarly, debt-like embedded derivative features may require separate accounting from\\nan equity-like host contract.\\n\\nThis standard is applicable as it relates to the accounting for the embedded features in the\\npreferred stock of the Company\\u2019s joint venture (see Note 3, Acquisitions and Joint Venture). As a result\\nof this guidance, the preferred stock host is now considered to be more akin to debt than equity and,\\naccordingly, certain of the embedded features are required to be bifurcated and accounted for as\\nderivative instruments. The derivative instruments are measured at fair value each reporting period,\\nwith changes recorded in Other (income) expense, net in the consolidated statements of operations.\\nThe Company early adopted this standard in the fourth quarter of 2015 on a modified retrospective\\nbasis. As a result of adopting this standard, the Company recorded a cumulative-effect adjustment\\nrelated to the impact from prior years to accumulated earnings (deficit) of $2.8 million in the first quarter\\nof 2015 with a corresponding increase to Other long-term liability in the consolidated balance sheet. In\\naddition, the Company recorded additional expense of $8.8 million to Other income (expense), net in\\nthe consolidated statement of operations, for the fair value change in the derivative instruments for the\\nyear ended December 31, 2015.\\n\\nThe impact to future periods will depend on changes in fair value of the derivative instruments,\\nwhich is correlated with the performance and value of the Company\\u2019s joint venture, and will be\\nrecorded in Other income (expense), net.\\n\\nDebt Issuance Costs\\n\\nIn April 2015, the FASB issued new authoritative accounting guidance on simplifying the\\npresentation of debt issuance costs, which requires that debt issuance costs related to a recognized\\ndebt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that\\ndebt liability, consistent with debt discounts. The Company early adopted the standard in the fourth\\nquarter of 2015 on a retrospective basis; however, the impact to the Company\\u2019s consolidated balance\\nsheet was not material and therefore no adjustments were recorded for prior periods. In the fourth\\nquarter of 2015, the Company reclassified $0.5 million of debt issuance costs from Other Assets to\\nConvertible senior notes, net in the consolidated balance sheet.\\n\\nDeferred Taxes\\n\\nIn November 2015, the FASB issued new authoritative accounting guidance on simplifying the\\npresentation of deferred income taxes, which requires that deferred income tax liabilities and assets be\\npresented as a net non-current deferred tax asset or liability by jurisdiction on the balance sheet. The\\ncurrent requirement that deferred tax assets and liabilities of a tax-paying component of an entity be\\noffset and presented as a single amount is unchanged. The ASU is effective for periods beginning after\\nDecember 15, 2016, however earlier adoption is permitted for all entities for any interim or annual\\nfinancial statements that have not been issued. The Company early adopted the standard in the fourth\\nquarter of 2015 on a prospective basis and, accordingly, reclassified $66.9 million of current deferred\\ntax assets from Other current assets to Other assets in the consolidated balance sheet. The prior year\\nbalances were not retrospectively adjusted.\\n\\n96\\n\\n\\n\\nCloud Computing Arrangements\\n\\nIn April 2015, the FASB issued new authoritative accounting guidance on customer\\u2019s accounting\\nfor fees paid in a cloud computing arrangement, which provides guidance to customers about whether\\na cloud computing arrangement includes a software license. If a cloud computing arrangement includes\\na software license, the customer should account for the software license element of the arrangement\\nconsistent with the acquisition of other software licenses. If the arrangement does not include a\\nsoftware license, the customer should account for a cloud computing arrangement as a service\\ncontract. This Company early adopted this standard in the fourth quarter of 2015 on a prospective\\nbasis, which had an immaterial impact on its financial statements.\\n\\nRecently Issued Accounting Guidance\\n\\nFinancial Instruments\\n\\nIn January 2016, FASB issued new authoritative accounting guidance on the classification and\\nmeasurement of financial instruments. The requirement to disclose the methods and significant\\nassumptions used to estimate fair value is removed. In addition, financial assets and financial liabilities\\nare to be presented separately in the notes to the financial statements, grouped by measurement\\ncategory and form of financial asset. This standard will be effective for the Company in the first quarter\\nof 2018; however, early adoption is permitted. The Company does not expect this standard to have a\\nmaterial impact on its financial statements.\\n\\nBusiness Combinations\\n\\nIn September 2015, FASB issued new authoritative accounting guidance on simplifying the\\naccounting for measurement-period adjustments in business combinations, which requires that an\\nacquirer recognize adjustments to provisional amounts that are identified during the measurement\\nperiod in the reporting period in which the adjustment amounts are determined. The effect on earnings\\nfor changes in depreciation or amortization, or other income effects (if any) as a result of the change to\\nthe provisional amounts, calculated as if the accounting had been completed as of the acquisition date,\\nmust be recorded in the reporting period in which the adjustment amounts are determined rather than\\nretrospectively. This standard will be applied prospectively to adjustments to provisional amounts that\\noccur after the effective date. This standard will be effective for the Company beginning in the first\\nquarter of 2016; however, early adoption is permitted. The Company does not expect this standard to\\nhave a material impact on its financial statements.\\n\\nRevenue Recognition\\n\\nIn May 2014, the FASB issued new authoritative accounting guidance on revenue from contracts\\nwith customers. The guidance outlines a single comprehensive model for entities to use in accounting\\nfor revenue arising from contracts with customers and supersedes most current revenue recognition\\nguidance, including industry-specific guidance. The core principle of the revenue model is that \\u2018\\u2018an\\nentity recognizes revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an\\namount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those\\ngoods or services.\\u2019\\u2019 The guidance also requires significantly expanded disclosures about revenue\\nrecognition. In July 2015, the FASB voted to approve a one-year deferral of the effective date to\\nDecember 15, 2017 for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after that date and permitted\\nearly adoption of the standard, but not before the original effective date of December 15, 2016.This\\nstandard will therefore be effective for the Company in the first quarter of 2018 and will be applied\\nusing either the full or modified retrospective adoption methods. The Company is currently evaluating\\nwhether this standard will have a material impact on its financial results.\\n\\n97\\n\\n\\n\\n2.

The key significant unobservable inputs in the OPM are the enterprise value of the\\nCompany\\u2019s joint venture, volatility, and expected term of when the embedded features will be\\nexercised. The enterprise value of the joint venture is estimated quarterly using a combination of\\nmarket and income approach methodologies. The volatility is based on historic volatilities of companies\\nwho have recently had initial public offerings.

Derivative Instruments\\n\\nThe Company has global operations and transacts business in multiple currencies, which exposes\\nit to foreign currency exchange rate risk. The Company enters into foreign currency derivative contracts\\nwith financial institutions to reduce the risk that its cash flows and earnings will be adversely affected\\nby foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. The Company\\u2019s program is not designated for trading\\nor speculative purposes.\\n\\nThese derivative instruments expose the Company to credit risk to the extent that the\\ncounterparties may be unable to meet the terms of the arrangement. The Company seeks to mitigate\\nthis credit risk by transacting with major financial institutions with high credit ratings. In addition, the\\nCompany generally enters into master netting arrangements, which mitigate credit risk by permitting net\\nsettlement of transactions with the same counterparty. The Company is not required to pledge, and is\\nnot entitled to receive, cash collateral related to these derivative instruments.\\n\\nCash Flow Hedges\\n\\nBeginning in the first quarter of 2015, the Company uses foreign currency derivative contracts\\ndesignated as cash flow hedges to hedge forecasted revenue transactions denominated in currencies\\n\\n107\\n\\n\\n\\nother than the US dollar. The Company\\u2019s cash flow hedges consist of forward and option contracts with\\nmaturities of 12 months or less.\\n\\nThe Company evaluates the effectiveness of its cash flow hedges on a quarterly basis.\\nEffectiveness represents a derivative instrument\\u2019s ability to generate offsetting changes in cash flows\\nrelated to the hedged risk. The Company records the gains or losses, net of tax, related to the effective\\nportion of its cash flow hedges as a component of Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)\\n(\\u2018\\u2018AOCI\\u2019\\u2019) in stockholders\\u2019 equity and subsequently reclassifies the gains or losses into revenue when\\nthe underlying hedged revenue is recognized. The Company records the gains or losses related to the\\nineffective portion of the cash flow hedges, if any, immediately in Other income (expense), net. The\\nchange in time value related to the Company\\u2019s cash flow hedges is excluded from the assessment of\\nhedge effectiveness and is recorded immediately in Other income (expense), net. If the hedged\\ntransaction becomes probable of not occurring, the corresponding amounts in AOCI would immediately\\nbe reclassified as ineffectiveness to Other income (expense), net. Cash flows related to the Company\\u2019s\\ncash flow hedging program are recognized as cash flows from operating activities in its statements of\\ncash flows.\\n\\nAs of December 31, 2015, the Company had outstanding cash flow hedges with a total notional\\namount of $321.5 million.\\n\\nBalance Sheet Hedges\\n\\nThe Company uses foreign currency derivative contracts not designated as hedging instruments\\n(\\u2018\\u2018balance sheet hedges\\u2019\\u2019) to reduce the exchange rate risk associated with its foreign currency\\ndenominated monetary assets and liabilities. These balance sheet hedges are marked-to-market at the\\nend of each reporting period and the related gains and losses are recognized in other income\\n(expense), net.\\n\\nAs of December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, the Company had outstanding balance sheet\\nhedges with a total notional amount of $239.9 million and $190.1 million, respectively.\\n\\nOther Derivative\\n\\nThe Company\\u2019s other derivative is related to the accounting for the embedded features on the\\npreferred stock of the Company\\u2019s joint venture, which is expected to be settled in cash at a value equal\\nto the fair value of the preferred stock, subject to a floor and a cap. This accounting is a result of the\\nCompany\\u2019s modified retrospective adoption of new authoritative accounting guidance on derivatives and\\nhedges. See Note 1, Description of Business and Summary of Accounting Policies, for additional\\ninformation on the adoption of this guidance.\\n\\nFair Value of Derivative Contracts\\n\\nThe foreign currency derivative contracts that were not settled at the end of the period and other\\nderivative instrument are recorded at fair value, on a gross basis, in the consolidated balance sheets.\\n\\n108\\n\\n\\n\\nThe following table presents the fair value of the Company\\u2019s derivative contracts as of the periods\\npresented (in thousands):\\n\\nDecember 31, December 31,\\n2015 2014\\n\\nDerivative assets:\\nCash flow hedges . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . $11,897 $ \\u2014\\nBalance sheet hedges . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 2,611 5,591\\n\\nTotal derivative assets . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 14,508 5,591\\n\\nDerivative liabilities:\\nCash flow hedges . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 790 \\u2014\\nBalance sheet hedges . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 1,057 149\\nOther derivative . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 11,600 \\u2014\\n\\nTotal derivative liabilities . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 13,447 149\\n\\nTotal fair value of derivative instruments . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . $ 1,061 $5,442\\n\\nSee Note 2, Fair Value Measurements, for additional information related to the fair value of the\\nCompany\\u2019s foreign currency derivative contracts and other derivative financial instrument.\\n\\nFinancial Statement Effect of Derivative Contracts\\n\\nThe following table presents the activity of the Company\\u2019s cash flow hedges in AOCI in\\nstockholders\\u2019 equity for the period presented(1) (in thousands):\\n\\nAmount of gain Amount of gain\\nrecognized in other reclassified from AOCI\\n\\ncomprehensive income before tax effect to\\nDecember 31, before tax effect net revenue (effective December 31,\\n\\n2014 (effective portion) portion) 2015\\n\\nCash flow hedges . . . . . . . . . $\\u2014 11,895 (38) $11,857\\n\\n(1) The Company did not have any cash flow hedges in 2014.\\n\\nThe amount recognized in earnings related to the ineffective portion of the Company\\u2019s cash flow\\nhedges was insignificant for the year.\\n\\nAs of December 31, 2015, the Company estimates approximately $11.9 million of net derivative\\ngains related to our cash flow hedges will be reclassified from AOCI into earnings within the next\\n12 months.\\n\\n109\\n\\n\\n\\nThe following table presents the impact of the Company\\u2019s derivative contracts on the consolidated\\nstatement of operations for the periods presented (in thousands):\\n\\nYear Ended December 31,\\n\\nLocation 2015 2014 2013\\n\\nCash flow hedges . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

The total net proceeds from this offering were $1,305.3 million,\\nafter deducting transaction costs related to the initial purchasers\\u2019 discount and debt issuance costs.\\n\\nThe Notes are governed by an indenture between the Company, as the issuer, and U.S. Bank\\nNational Association, as Trustee. The Notes are unsecured and do not contain any financial covenants\\nor any restrictions on the payment of dividends, the incurrence of senior debt or other indebtedness, or\\nthe issuance or repurchase of securities by the Company. The Notes mature on November 1, 2019,\\nunless converted, and bear interest at a rate of 0.50% payable semi-annually in arrears on May 1 and\\nNovember 1 of each year, commencing May 1, 2015.\\n\\nThe Notes are convertible at an initial conversion rate of 3.3951 shares of common stock per\\n$1,000 principal amount of notes, which is equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately\\n$294.54 per share of common stock.\\n\\n112\\n\\n\\n\\nHolders may convert their notes under the following circumstances:\\n\\n\\u2022 during any calendar quarter beginning after the calendar quarter ending on March 31, 2015 (and\\nonly during such calendar quarter), if, for at least 20 trading days during the 30 consecutive\\ntrading days ending on the last trading day of the immediately preceding calendar quarter the\\nlast reported sale price of the Company\\u2019s Class A common stock is greater than or equal to\\n130% of the conversion price;\\n\\n\\u2022 during the five business day period after any five consecutive trading day period when the\\ntrading price per $1,000 principal amount of notes for each trading day is less than 98% of the\\nproduct of the last reported sales price of the Company\\u2019s Class A common stock and the\\nconversion rate; or\\n\\n\\u2022 upon the occurrence of specified corporate events.\\n\\nOn or after May 1, 2019, up until the close of business on the second trading day immediately\\npreceding the maturity date, a holder may convert all or any portion of its notes regardless of the\\nforegoing conditions. Upon conversion, the Company will pay or deliver, as the case may be, cash,\\nshares of its Class A common stock, or a combination of cash and shares of its Class A common\\nstock, at the Company\\u2019s election. The Company intends to settle the principal and interest due on the\\nNotes in cash.\\n\\nThe conversion rate will be subject to adjustment in some events but will not be adjusted for any\\naccrued or unpaid interest. A holder who converts its notes in connection with certain corporate events\\nthat constitute a \\u2018\\u2018make-whole fundamental change\\u2019\\u2019 per the indenture governing the Notes are, under\\ncertain circumstances, entitled to an increase in the conversion rate. In addition, if the Company\\nundergoes a fundamental change prior to the maturity date, holders may require the Company to\\nrepurchase for cash all or a portion of its notes at a repurchase price equal to 100% of the principal\\namount of the repurchased notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest.\\n\\nIn accounting for the issuance of the Notes, the Company separated the Notes into liability and\\nequity components. The carrying amount of the liability component was calculated by measuring the\\nfair value of a similar liability that does not have an associated convertible feature. The carrying amount\\nof the equity component, representing the conversion option, was determined by deducting the fair\\nvalue of the liability component from the par value of the Notes. The difference between the principal\\namount of the Notes and the liability component (the \\u2018\\u2018debt discount\\u2019\\u2019) is amortized to interest expense\\nusing the effective interest method over the term of the Notes. The equity component of the Notes is\\nincluded in additional paid-in capital in the consolidated balance sheet and is not remeasured as long\\nas it continues to meet the conditions for equity classification.\\n\\nThe Company incurred transaction costs of approximately $0.7 million related to the issuance of\\nthe Notes. In accounting for the transaction costs, the Company allocated the total amount incurred to\\nthe liability and equity components using the same proportions as the proceeds from the Notes.\\nTransaction costs attributable to the liability component are netted against the carrying amount of the\\nliability in the consolidated balance sheet and are amortized to interest expense over the term of the\\nNotes, and transaction costs attributable to the equity component were netted with the equity\\ncomponent in stockholders\\u2019 equity.\\n\\n113\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Notes consisted of the following (in thousands):\\n\\nDecember 31,\\n\\n2015 2014\\n\\nLiability:\\nPrincipal . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . $1,322,500 $1,322,500\\nLess: debt discount and issuance costs, net of amortization(1) . . . . . . . . . . .

As a result, the Company\\nreclassified $0.5 million of debt issuance costs to Convertible Senior Notes, net. No adjustments\\nwere recorded for prior periods as the impact to the Company\\u2019s consolidated balance sheet was\\nnot material.\\n\\nThe Company recognized interest expense on the Notes as follows (in thousands, except for\\npercentage):\\n\\nYear Ended\\nDecember 31,\\n\\n2015 2014\\n\\nContractual interest expense based on 0.50% per annum . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . $ 6,631 $ 881\\nAmortization of debt discount and issuance costs . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 45,559 5,916\\n\\nTotal . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . $52,190 $6,797\\n\\nEffective interest rate of the liability component . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 4.7% 4.7%\\n\\nThe total estimated fair value of the Notes as of December 31, 2015 was $1,382.0 million. The fair\\nvalue was determined based on the closing trading price of the Notes as of the last day of trading for\\nthe period. The Company considers the fair value of the Notes to be a Level 2 measurement due to\\nthe limited trading activity of the Notes.\\n\\nBased on the closing price of our Class A common stock of $225.08 on December 31, 2015, the\\nif-converted value of the Notes was less than the principal amount.\\n\\nNote Hedges and Warrants\\n\\nConcurrently with the issuance of the Notes, the Company purchased options (\\u2018\\u2018Note Hedges\\u2019\\u2019)\\nwith respect to its Class A common stock for $248.0 million with certain bank counterparties. The Note\\nHedges cover up to 4,490,020 shares of the Company\\u2019s Class A common stock at a strike price of\\n$294.54 per share, which corresponds to the initial conversion price of the Notes, and are exercisable\\nby the Company upon conversion of the Notes. The Note Hedges are intended to reduce the potential\\neconomic dilution upon conversion of the Notes. The Note Hedges are separate transactions and are\\nnot part of the terms of the Notes. Holders of the Notes will not have any rights with respect to the\\nNote Hedges.\\n\\nConcurrently with the issuance of the Notes, the Company sold warrants to bank counterparties for\\ntotal proceeds of $167.3 million that provides the counterparties with the right to buy up to 4,490,020\\nshares of our Class A common stock at a strike price of $381.82 per share. The warrants are separate\\n\\n114\\n\\n\\n\\ntransactions and are not part of the Notes or Note Hedges. Holders of the Notes and Note Hedges will\\nnot have any rights with respect to the Warrants.\\n\\nThe amounts paid and received for the Note Hedges and warrants have been recorded in\\nadditional paid-in capital in the consolidated balance sheets. The fair value of the Note Hedges and\\nwarrants are not remeasured through earnings each reporting period. The amounts paid for the Note\\nHedges are tax deductible expenses, while the proceeds received from the warrants are not taxable.\\n\\nImpact to Earnings per Share\\n\\nThe Notes will have no impact to diluted earnings per share until the average price of our Class A\\ncommon stock exceeds the conversion price of $294.54 per share because the principal amount of the\\nNotes is intended to be settled in cash upon conversion. Under the treasury stock method, in periods\\nthe Company reports net income, the Company is required to include the effect of additional shares\\nthat may be issued under the Notes when the price of the Company\\u2019s Class A common stock exceeds\\nthe conversion price. Under this method, the cumulative dilutive effect of the Notes would be\\napproximately 1,026,000 shares if the average price of the Company\\u2019s Class A common stock is\\n$381.82. However, upon conversion, there will be no economic dilution from the Notes, as exercise of\\nthe Note Hedges eliminates any dilution from the Notes that would have otherwise occurred when the\\nprice of the Company\\u2019s Class A common stock exceeds the conversion price. The Note Hedges are\\nrequired to be excluded from the calculation of diluted earnings per share, as they would be\\nanti-dilutive under the treasury stock method.\\n\\nThe warrants will have a dilutive effect when the average share price exceeds the warrant\\u2019s strike\\nprice of $381.82 per share. As the price of the Company\\u2019s Class A common stock continues to\\nincrease above the warrant strike price, additional dilution would occur at a declining rate so that a $10\\nincrease from the warrant strike price would yield cumulative dilution of approximately 1,229,000 diluted\\nshares for EPS purposes. However, upon conversion, the Note Hedges would neutralize the dilution\\nfrom the Notes so that there would only be dilution from the warrants, which would result in actual\\ndilution of approximately 115,000 shares at a common stock price of $391.82.\\n\\n10.

As a result, the Company\\n\\n115\\n\\n\\n\\nrecorded an other derivative, which was subject to fair value adjustments during 2015.

Income (Loss) Per Share\\n\\nBasic and diluted net income (loss) per common share is presented in conformity with the\\ntwo-class method required for participating securities.\\n\\nClass A and Class B common stock are the only outstanding equity in the Company. The rights of\\nthe holders of Class A and Class B common stock are identical, except with respect to voting and\\nconversion. Each share of Class A common stock is entitled to one vote per share and each share of\\nClass B common stock is entitled to ten votes per share. Shares of Class B common stock may be\\nconverted into Class A common stock at any time at the option of the stockholder, and are\\nautomatically converted to Class A common stock upon a sale or transfer, subject to certain limited\\nexceptions.\\n\\nBasic net income (loss) per share attributable to common stockholders is computed using the\\nweighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted net income (loss)\\nper share attributable to common stockholders is computed using the weighted-average number of\\ncommon shares and, if dilutive, potential common shares outstanding during the period. The\\nCompany\\u2019s potential common shares consist of shares issuable upon the release of RSUs, and to a\\nlesser extent, the incremental common shares issuable upon the exercise of stock options and\\npurchases related to the 2011 Employee Stock Purchase Plan. The dilutive effect of these potential\\ncommon shares is reflected in diluted earnings per share by application of the treasury stock method.\\nThe computation of the diluted net income (loss) per share of Class A common stock assumes the\\nconversion of Class B common stock, while the diluted net income (loss) per share of Class B common\\nstock does not assume the conversion of Class A common stock as Class A common stock is not\\nconvertible into Class B common stock.\\n\\nThe undistributed earnings are allocated based on the contractual participation rights of the\\nClass A and Class B common shares as if the earnings for the year had been distributed. As the\\nliquidation and dividend rights are identical, the undistributed earnings are allocated on a proportionate\\nbasis. Further, as the conversion of Class B common stock is assumed in the computation of the\\ndiluted net income (loss) per share of Class A common stock, the undistributed earnings are equal to\\nnet income (loss) for that computation.\\n\\n116\\n\\n\\n\\nThe following table presents the calculation of basic and diluted net income (loss) per share\\nattributable to common stockholders (in thousands, except per share data):\\n\\nYear Ended December 31,\\n\\n2015 2014 2013\\n\\nClass A Class B Class A Class B Class A Class B\\n\\nBasic net income (loss) per share attributable to\\ncommon stockholders:\\nNumerator:\\n\\nAllocation of undistributed earnings . . . . . . . . . $(145,978) $(20,166) $ (13,659) $ (2,088) $ 22,443 $ 4,326\\nDenominator:\\n\\nWeighted-average common shares outstanding . 113,364 15,660 106,518 16,282 95,282 18,361\\nBasic net income (loss) per share attributable to\\n\\ncommon stockholders . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . $ (1.29) $ (1.29) $ (0.13) $ (0.13) $ 0.24 $ 0.24\\n\\nDiluted net income (loss) per share attributable to\\ncommon stockholders:\\nNumerator:\\n\\nAllocation of undistributed earnings for basic\\ncomputation . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . $(145,978) $(20,166) $ (13,659) $ (2,088) $ 22,443 $ 4,326\\n\\nReallocation of undistributed earnings as a\\nresult of conversion of Class B to Class A\\nshares . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

Although\\noccasional adverse decisions or settlements may occur, the Company does not believe that the final\\ndisposition of any of these matters will have a material adverse effect on the business. Certain of these\\nmatters include speculative claims for substantial or indeterminate amounts of damages, and include\\nclaims for injunctive relief. Additionally, the Company\\u2019s litigation costs can be significant. Other\\nregulatory matters could result in fines and penalties being assessed against the Company, and it may\\nbecome subject to mandatory periodic audits, which would likely increase its regulatory compliance\\ncosts. Adverse results of litigation or regulatory matters could also result in the Company being\\nrequired to change its business practices, which could negatively impact its membership and revenue\\ngrowth.\\n\\nThe Company records a liability when it believes that it is both probable that a loss has been\\nincurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. The Company periodically evaluates\\ndevelopments in its legal matters that could affect the amount of liability that it has previously accrued,\\nif any, and makes adjustments as appropriate. Significant judgment is required to determine both\\nlikelihood of there being, and the estimated amount of, a loss related to such matters, and the\\nCompany\\u2019s judgment may be incorrect. The outcome of any proceeding is not determinable in\\nadvance. Until the final resolution of any such matters that the Company may be required to accrue for,\\nit may be exposed to loss in excess of the amount accrued, and such amounts could be material.\\n\\nIndemnifications\\n\\nIn the ordinary course of business, the Company enters into contractual arrangements under which\\nit agrees to provide indemnification of varying scope and terms to business partners and other parties\\nwith respect to certain matters, including, but not limited to, losses arising out of the Company\\u2019s breach\\n\\n118\\n\\n\\n\\nof such agreements and out of intellectual property infringement claims made by third parties. In these\\ncircumstances, payment may be conditional on the other party making a claim pursuant to the\\nprocedures specified in the particular contract. Further, the Company\\u2019s obligations under these\\nagreements may be limited in terms of time and/or amount, and in some instances, it may have\\nrecourse against third parties for certain payments. In addition, the Company has indemnification\\nagreements with certain of its directors and executive officers that require it, among other things, to\\nindemnify them against certain liabilities that may arise by reason of their status or service as directors\\nor officers with the Company. The terms of such obligations may vary.\\n\\n13. Stockholders\\u2019 Equity\\n\\nFollow-on Offering\\n\\nIn September 2013, the Company closed a follow-on offering, at which time it sold a total of\\n6,188,340 shares of its Class A common stock (inclusive of 807,174 shares from the full exercise of the\\nover-allotment option granted to the underwriters). The public offering price of the shares sold in the\\noffering was $223.00 per share. The total gross proceeds from the offering to the Company were\\n$1,380.0 million. After deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses, the\\naggregate net proceeds received by the Company totaled approximately $1,348.1 million.\\n\\nPreferred Stock\\n\\nAfter its initial public offering (\\u2018\\u2018IPO\\u2019\\u2019), the Company had 100,000,000 shares of preferred stock\\nauthorized, none of which were issued and outstanding as of December 31, 2015 and 2014.\\n\\nCommon Stock\\n\\nThe Company has two classes of authorized common stock outstanding; Class A common stock\\nand Class B common stock at a maximum aggregate number authorized of 1,000,000,000 and\\n120,000,000, respectively. As of December 31, 2015, the Company had outstanding 116,468,385\\nshares of Class A common stock and 15,580,510 shares of Class B common stock. The rights of the\\nholders of Class A and Class B common stock are identical, except with respect to voting and\\nconversion. Each share of Class A common stock is entitled to one vote per share and each share of\\nClass B common stock is entitled to ten votes per share. Shares of Class B common stock may be\\nconverted into Class A common stock at any time at the option of the stockholder, and are\\nautomatically converted upon sale or transfer to Class A common stock, subject to certain limited\\nexceptions. After its IPO, the Company had an additional 1,000,000,000 shares of common stock\\nauthorized, none of which were issued and outstanding as of December 31, 2015 and 2014.\\n\\nCommon Stock Reserved for Future Issuance\\n\\nAs of December 31, 2015, the Company had reserved shares of common stock for future\\nissuances in connection with the following:\\n\\nOptions outstanding . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 2,582,517\\nRSUs outstanding . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 6,136,702\\nAvailable for future stock option and RSU grants . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 2,131,126\\nAvailable for future employee stock purchase plan awards . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 2,327,377\\n\\nTotal reserved for future issuance . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 13,177,722\\n\\n119\\n\\n\\n\\nEquity Incentive Plans\\n\\nThe Company has two equity incentive plans: the Amended and Restated 2003 Stock Incentive\\nPlan (the \\u2018\\u20182003 Plan\\u2019\\u2019) and the 2011 Equity Incentive Plan (the \\u2018\\u20182011 Plan\\u2019\\u2019 and together with the 2003\\nPlan, the \\u2018\\u2018Equity Plans\\u2019\\u2019). As of December 31, 2015, a total of 50,814,756 shares of common stock\\nwere authorized for the issuance of equity awards under the Equity Plans. Upon the Company\\u2019s IPO in\\n2011, the 2003 Plan was terminated and all shares that remained available for future issuance under\\nthe 2003 Plan at the time of its termination were transferred to the 2011 Plan.

The Company estimates forfeitures of unvested stock awards based on the Company\\u2019s\\nhistorical experience. To the extent actual forfeitures differ from the estimates, the difference will be\\nrecorded as a cumulative adjustment in the period the estimates are revised. Compensation cost is not\\nrecorded for awards that do not vest. The fair value of RSUs is based on the closing market price of\\nour common stock on the date of grant. The fair value of options and ESPP shares is estimated using\\nthe Black-Scholes option valuation model, which requires the Company to make the following\\nassumptions and judgments about the variables used in the calculation:\\n\\nVolatility. The volatility is based on the historical volatility of the Company\\u2019s common stock.\\n\\nExpected dividend yield. The Company uses an expected dividend yield of zero as it does\\nnot anticipate paying any dividends in the foreseeable future.\\n\\nRisk-free rate. The risk-free rate is based on the US Treasury yield curve in effect at the time\\nof grant for periods corresponding with the expected life of the award.\\n\\nExpected term. Beginning in 2014, the Company transitioned from using the simplified\\nmethod for calculating the expected term of options as described in the SEC\\u2019s Staff\\nAccounting Bulletin No. 107, Share-Based Payment, because it believes there is sufficient\\nhistorical information to derive a reasonable estimate. The calculation considers a combination\\nof historical and estimated future exercise behavior.\\n\\nThe following table presents the weighted-average assumptions used to estimate the fair value of\\noptions granted during the periods presented, excluding assumed acquisition-related stock options:\\n\\nYear Ended\\nDecember 31,\\n\\n2015 2014 2013\\n\\nVolatility . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 47% 45% 54%\\nExpected dividend yield . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . \\u2014 \\u2014 \\u2014\\nRisk-free rate . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 1.37% 1.17% 1.15%\\nExpected term (in years) . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 4.01 4.07 6.27\\n\\n123\\n\\n\\n\\nThe weighted-average grant date fair value of options granted, excluding assumed acquisition-\\nrelated stock options, was $99.13, $76.39 and $89.13, for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014\\nand 2013, respectively.

Due to the history of losses the Company has\\ngenerated in the past in certain jurisdictions, the Company believes that it is more likely than not that\\nCalifornia and certain international deferred tax assets will not be realized as of December 31, 2015.\\nAccordingly, the Company has recorded a valuation allowance on such deferred tax assets. The\\nvaluation allowance increased by $58.5 million and $16.4 million during the year ended December 31,\\n2015 and 2014, respectively. The increase in valuation allowance for 2015 is primarily related to\\nCalifornia research and development credits as well as establishment of valuation allowance on certain\\nforeign deferred tax assets.\\n\\nPursuant to authoritative guidance, the benefit of stock options will only be recorded to\\nstockholders\\u2019 equity when cash taxes payable is reduced. As of December 31, 2015, the portion of net\\noperating loss carryforwards and credit carryforwards related to stock options is approximately\\n$463.6 million tax-effected. This amount will be credited to stockholders\\u2019 equity when it is realized on\\nthe tax return.\\n\\n126\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Company regularly assesses the realizability of its deferred tax assets and establishes a\\nvaluation allowance if it is more-likely-than-not that some portion of the deferred tax assets will not be\\nrealized. The Company weighs all available positive and negative evidence, including earnings history\\nand results of recent operations, scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable\\nincome, and tax planning strategies. Assumptions used to forecast future taxable income often require\\nsignificant judgment. More weight is given to objectively verifiable evidence. In the event the Company\\ndetermines that it would not be able to realize all or part of its net deferred tax assets in the future, a\\nvaluation allowance will be established against deferred tax assets in the period in which the Company\\nmakes such determination. The need to establish a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets\\nmay cause greater volatility in the effective tax rate. It is reasonably possible that any such adjustment\\nwould materially change in the next 12 months.\\n\\nAs of December 31, 2015, the Company had net operating loss carryforwards for federal income\\ntax return purposes of approximately $1,217.5 million, which expire at various dates beginning in the\\nyear 2023, if not utilized. The Company had net operating loss carryforwards of approximately\\n$572.5 million for California income tax return purposes and approximately $1,234.0 million for other\\nstate income tax return purposes which expire at various dates beginning in the year 2023, if not\\nutilized.\\n\\nAs of December 31, 2015, the Company had research and development credit carryforwards for\\nfederal income tax return purposes of approximately $113.8 million, which expire at various dates\\nbeginning in the year 2023, if not utilized. The Company had research and development credit\\ncarryforwards for state income tax return purposes of approximately $107.8 million, which can be\\ncarried forward indefinitely.\\n\\nUtilization of the net operating loss carryforwards and credits may be subject to a substantial\\nannual limitation due to the ownership change limitations provided by the Internal Revenue Code of\\n1986, as amended and similar state provisions. The annual limitation may result in the expiration of net\\noperating losses and credits before utilization. The Company believes an ownership change, as defined\\nunder Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code, existed in prior years, and has reduced its net\\noperating loss carryforwards to reflect the limitation.\\n\\nAs of December 31, 2015, the Company had approximately $81.0 million in total unrecognized tax\\nbenefits. A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits is as follows\\n(in thousands):\\n\\nYear Ended\\nDecember 31,\\n\\n2015 2014\\n\\nUnrecognized tax benefits balance at January 1 . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . $66,508 $43,735\\nGross increase for tax positions of prior years . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 2,268 2,116\\nGross decrease for tax positions of prior years . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

If the $66.5 million of unrecognized tax benefits as of December 31, 2014 is\\nrecognized, approximately $38.1 million would decrease the effective tax rate in the period in which\\neach of the benefits is recognized. The remaining amount would be offset by the reversal of related\\ndeferred tax assets on which a valuation allowance is in place.\\n\\n127\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Company recognizes interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions in income tax\\nexpense. As of December 31, 2015 and 2014, penalties and interest were immaterial.\\n\\nThe Company files income tax returns in the US federal jurisdiction as well as many US states and\\nforeign jurisdictions. The tax years 2003 to 2014 remain open to examination by the various\\njurisdictions in which the Company is subject to tax. Fiscal years outside the normal statute of limitation\\nremain open to audit by tax authorities due to tax attributes generated in those early years which have\\nbeen carried forward and may be audited in subsequent years when utilized.\\n\\nThe Company is subject to the continuous examination of income tax returns by various tax\\nauthorities. The Company regularly assesses the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these\\nexaminations to determine the adequacy of the provision for income taxes. The Company believes that\\nadequate amounts have been reserved for any adjustments that may ultimately result from these\\nexaminations and does not anticipate a significant impact to the gross unrecognized tax benefits within\\nthe next 12 months related to these years. In October 2015, the Company signed a closing agreement\\nwith the Internal Revenue Service (\\u2018\\u2018IRS\\u2019\\u2019) for certain transfer pricing tax positions in years 2010\\nthrough 2012. As a result, the Company paid cash tax $0.4 million and recognized a benefit of\\n$5.9 million.\\n\\nOn December 1, 2015, in Altera Corp. v. Commissioner, the US Tax Court formally entered its\\ndecision related to the treatment of stock-based compensation expense in an intercompany\\ncost-sharing arrangement. At this time, the US Department of the Treasury has not withdrawn the\\nrequirement to include stock-based compensation from its regulations. Due to the uncertainty\\nsurrounding the status of the current regulations, questions related to the scope of potential benefits,\\nand the risk of the Tax Court\\u2019s decision being overturned upon appeal, we have not recorded any\\nimpact as of December 31, 2015. We will continue to monitor ongoing developments and potential\\nimpacts to our financial statements.\\n\\nThe Company attributes net revenue, costs and expenses to domestic and foreign components\\nbased on the terms of its agreements with its subsidiaries. The Company does not provide for federal\\nincome taxes on the undistributed earnings of its foreign subsidiaries, as such earnings are to be\\nreinvested offshore indefinitely. The income tax liability would be insignificant if these earnings were to\\nbe repatriated.\\n\\n16. Information About Revenue and Geographic Areas\\n\\nThe Company considers operating segments to be components of the Company in which separate\\nfinancial information is available that is evaluated regularly by the Company\\u2019s chief operating decision\\nmaker in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance. The chief operating\\ndecision maker for the Company is the Chief Executive Officer (\\u2018\\u2018CEO\\u2019\\u2019). The CEO reviews financial\\ninformation presented on a consolidated basis, accompanied by information about revenue by product,\\nsales channel, and geographic region for purposes of allocating resources and evaluating financial\\nperformance. Accordingly, the Company has determined that it has one operating segment, and\\ntherefore, one reportable segment.\\n\\n128\\n\\n\\n\\nRevenue by geography is generally based on the shipping address of the customer. The following\\ntables present the Company\\u2019s revenue by product line, as well as revenue and long-lived assets by\\ngeographic region for the periods presented (in thousands):\\n\\nYear Ended December 31,\\n\\n2015 2014 2013\\n\\nNet revenue by product:\\nTalent Solutions\\n\\nHiring . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . $1,769,771 $1,327,737 $ 910,257\\nLearning & Development . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 107,424 \\u2014 \\u2014\\n\\nTotal Talent Solutions . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 1,877,195 1,327,737 910,257\\nMarketing Solutions . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 581,328 454,500 311,777\\nPremium Subscriptions . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 532,388 436,530 306,511\\n\\nTotal . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . $2,990,911 $2,218,767 $1,528,545\\n\\nYear Ended December 31,\\n\\n2015 2014 2013\\n\\nNet revenue by geographic region:\\nUnited States . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . $1,845,808 $1,333,978 $ 942,122\\nOther Americas(1) . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 167,975 143,207 109,672\\n\\nTotal Americas . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 2,013,783 1,477,185 1,051,794\\nEMEA(2) . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 730,244 554,567 358,244\\nAPAC(3) . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 246,884 187,015 118,507\\n\\nTotal . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . $2,990,911 $2,218,767 $1,528,545\\n\\n(1) Canada, Latin America and South America\\n\\n(2) Europe, the Middle East and Africa (\\u2018\\u2018EMEA\\u2019\\u2019)\\n\\n(3) Asia-Pacific (\\u2018\\u2018APAC\\u2019\\u2019)\\n\\nNo individual customer accounted for 10% or more of consolidated net revenue or accounts\\nreceivable for any of the periods presented.\\n\\nLong-Lived Assets\\n\\nDecember 31,\\n\\n2015 2014\\n\\nUnited States . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . $ 860,955 $657,788\\nOther Americas . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 14,224 11,326\\n\\nTotal Americas . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 875,179 669,114\\nEMEA . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 77,369 40,944\\nAPAC . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 94,457 30,851\\n\\nTotal . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . $1,047,005 $740,909\\n\\n129\\n\\n\\n\\n17. Subsequent Events\\n\\nIn February 2016, the Company entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Connectifier, an\\nindustry leader in machine learning-based searching and matching technology. The acquisition will be\\naccounted for as business combination with an estimated purchase price of approximately\\n$100.0 million, paid in combination of cash and Class A common stock, and anticipated to close in the\\nfirst quarter of 2016. For accounting purposes, the equity consideration will be valued based on the\\nclosing price of the Company\\u2019s Class A common stock as reported by the NYSE on the closing of the\\nacquisition, and is therefore subject to change.\\n\\n130\\n\\n\\n\\nItem 9.

Controls and Procedures\\n\\nDisclosure Controls and Procedures\\n\\nAs of the end of the period covered by this report, our management conducted an evaluation,\\nunder the supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial\\nOfficer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as\\nsuch term is defined in the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Exchange Act). Based upon that\\nevaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure\\ncontrols and procedures were effective as of the end of the period covered by this report in ensuring\\nthat information required to be disclosed was recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the\\ntime periods specified in the SEC\\u2019s rules and forms, and to provide reasonable assurance that\\ninformation required to be disclosed by us in such reports is accumulated and communicated to our\\nmanagement, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow\\ntimely decisions regarding required disclosure.\\n\\nManagement\\u2019s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\\n\\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over\\nfinancial reporting, as such term is defined in the Exchange Act. Under the supervision and with the\\nparticipation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, our management conducted an\\nevaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based upon the framework\\nin \\u2018\\u2018Internal Control\\u2014Integrated Framework (2013)\\u2019\\u2019 issued by the Committee of Sponsoring\\nOrganizations of the Treadway Commission. Our management\\u2019s evaluation of internal control over\\nfinancial reporting excluded the internal control activities of lynda.com, Inc. (\\u2018\\u2018Lynda.com\\u2019\\u2019), which we\\nacquired on May 14, 2015, and whose financial statements constitute 1.5% of net assets and 3.5% of\\nnet revenue of our consolidated financial statement amounts as of and for the year ended\\nDecember 31, 2015. Based on that evaluation, management concluded that our internal control over\\nfinancial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2015.\\n\\nDeloitte & Touche LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, has audited the\\nconsolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-K and, as part of the audit, has issued a\\nreport, included herein, on the effectiveness of LinkedIn\\u2019s internal control over financial reporting as of\\nDecember 31, 2015.\\n\\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\\n\\nDuring the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015, there were no changes in the internal control over financial\\nreporting that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, LinkedIn\\u2019s internal control\\nover financial reporting.\\n\\nInherent Limitations of Disclosure Controls and Procedures and Internal Control over Financial\\nReporting\\n\\nIt should be noted that any system of controls, however well designed and operated, can provide\\nonly reasonable, and not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the system will be met. In addition,\\nthe design of any control system is based in part upon certain assumptions made by management\\nabout the likelihood of future events.\\n\\n131\\n\\n\\n\\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\\n\\nTo the Board of Directors and Stockholders of\\nLinkedIn Corporation\\nMountain View, California\\n\\nWe have audited the internal control over financial reporting of LinkedIn Corporation and\\nsubsidiaries (the \\u2018\\u2018Company\\u2019\\u2019) as of December 31, 2015, based on criteria established in Internal\\nControl\\u2014Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the\\nTreadway Commission. As described in Management\\u2019s Report on Internal Control over Financial\\nReporting, management excluded from its assessment the internal control over financial reporting at\\nlynda.com, Inc. (\\u2018\\u2018Lynda.com\\u2019\\u2019), which was acquired on May 14, 2015, and whose financial statements\\nconstitute 1.5% of net assets and 3.5% of net revenue of the consolidated financial statement amounts\\nas of and for the year ended December 31, 2015. Accordingly, our audit did not include the internal\\ncontrol over financial reporting at Lynda.com. The Company\\u2019s management is responsible for\\nmaintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness\\nof internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management\\u2019s Report on\\nInternal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company\\u2019s\\ninternal control over financial reporting based on our audit.\\n\\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting\\nOversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain\\nreasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained\\nin all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial\\nreporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and\\noperating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other\\nprocedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a\\nreasonable basis for our opinion.\\n\\nA company\\u2019s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the\\nsupervision of, the company\\u2019s principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing\\nsimilar functions, and effected by the company\\u2019s board of directors, management, and other personnel\\nto provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of\\nfinancial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.\\nA company\\u2019s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that\\n(1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the\\ntransactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that\\ntransactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with\\ngenerally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being\\nmade only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and\\n(3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition,\\nuse, or disposition of the company\\u2019s assets that could have a material effect on the financial\\nstatements.\\n\\nBecause of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the\\npossibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to\\nerror or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Also, projections of any evaluation\\nof the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the\\nrisk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of\\ncompliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\\n\\nIn our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over\\nfinancial reporting as of December 31, 2015, based on the criteria established in Internal Control\\u2014\\n\\n132\\n\\n\\n\\nIntegrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway\\nCommission.\\n\\nWe have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting\\nOversight Board (United States), the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended\\nDecember 31, 2015, of the Company and our report dated February 11, 2016, expressed an\\nunqualified opinion on those financial statements.\\n\\n/s/ DELOITTE & TOUCHE LLP\\nSan Jose, California\\nFebruary 11, 2016\\n\\n133\\n\\n\\n\\nItem 9B.
